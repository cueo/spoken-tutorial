Welcome Spoken tutorial LibreOffice Base. In tutorial, learn following topics: Indexes Table Filter And SQL Command window. Let us first learn Indexes. What Index? An Index way find sort records within database table faster. We choose one field multiple fields table records need indexed. The Index stores location records based chosen field fields. So, retrieve data, Base move location data directly using index. And so, considerably faster scanning records find data. The primary key table automatically indexed. Now, let us create index example Library database. We create index Title column Books table speed searching book titles. Let us first open 'Library' database, already opened. And open Books table Edit mode. In Table Design window, let us go Tools menu choose Index Design. In Indexes window, notice Base already included Primary Key Unique Index. Let us click left icon, New Index, create index. And choose Title drop-down list Index field right. We also choose Ascending Descending order rename index ‘IDX_Title’ clicking third icon left save using Save icon next it. So, index Title field. In way create, edit, rename delete indexes tables using Base. Here assignment you: Create index names Members table call ‘IDX_MemberName’. Next, let us see Table Filter is. 'Table Filter' feature allows us hide tables Base database applications. As example, let us hide tables except Books table 'Library' database. Now, Table Filter available Tools menu. Here, let us check All Views check Books table. Meaning, marking Books table visible applications. Now, let us click OK button. Next, click View menu Refresh Tables. Notice Books table visible here. Also, accessing database LibreOffice Writer Calc, see Books table there. Here another assignment: 1. Open LibreOffice Writer, access Library database check tables available there. 2. Bring back tables visibility Base. 3. And reopen 'LibreOffice Writer' check tables’ availability again. Finally, let us learn SQL command window. The 'SQL command window' accessed choosing SQL Tools menu. We use window issue SQL statements database. Now, also use Queries execute SQL queries limited asking data database. Meaning, issue SELECT statements there. But cannot execute SQL statements modify data table structures create new tables there. And 'SQL command window' helps us use data manipulation data definition statements language. Examples Data Manipulation Language simply DML are: INSERT, UPDATE DELETE data. And examples Data Definition Language simply DDL are: CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE ALTER statements. We first see DML example. In Base window, let us open SQL Command Window Tools menu. Let us insert new record Books table typing “Command execute” text area: INSERT INTO "Books" ( "Title", "Author", "PublishYear", "Publisher", "Price") VALUES ('The Hobbit', 'J.R.R Tolkien', 2002, 'Oxford', 500); Before clicking Execute button, let us look command closely now. The INSERT statement lists table name field names Values need go new record. Notice table name field names enclosed double quotes. We know Base case sensitive double quotes ensure Base accept names created. If don’t use quotes, Base automatically convert names upper cases. We use single quotes encase values data type TEXT. NUMERIC fields need encased quotes. Also, need include BookId field AutoNumber field. Base take care auto-generating number. So, let us execute SQL. Notice message ‘Command successfully executed’. If errors SQL wrote, Base point out. Let us double-click Books table look new record inserted. There is, appended last row. Next, let us see DDL example. We create new table called Authors fields AuthorId, Author Country. In SQL command window, let us type shown screen execute it. Let us go back Tables list Refresh tables View menu. There new Authors table created. To know DML, visit website shown screen. To know DDL visit Wikipedia website shown screen. Here another assignment you: 1. Use UPDATE statement set price book BookId 3, Rs. 300 2. Delete book title ‘'The Hobbit' 3. Insert new record Authors table, author name ‘J.R.R. Tolkien’, country as‘England’ 4. Drop Authors table database using DROP statement. This brings us end tutorial LibreOffice Base. To summarize, learned following topics: Indexes Table Filter And SQL Command window.
