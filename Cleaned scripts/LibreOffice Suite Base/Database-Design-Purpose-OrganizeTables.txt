Welcome Spoken tutorial LibreOffice Base. In tutorial, learn following topics database design: * Determining purpose database * Finding organizing information required * Dividing information tables. What Database Design? 'Database design' process producing detailed data model database. With good design, database provide up-to-date, accurate complete information. Which means- ensure integrity information various levels, meet needs data processing reporting easily accommodate change. The process database design consists following steps: * Determine purpose database * Find organize information required * Divide information tables * Turn information items columns * Specify primary keys * Set table relationships * Refine design * Apply normalization rules * And finally, test, run database maintain. Okay, let us go first step is- Determine purpose database. Let us consider simple Library Application. A library usually books. And books issued registered members. So, need Library application maintain list books members. And track issuing books members. Our first step find organize required information. Here gather types information want record database. Now know purpose 'Library application', let us identify items here. There books. A Book title, author, publisher price. And also store author’s information as, date birth country belongs to. We also store publisher’s name, address phone. Also, 'Library' members names, phone numbers addresses. Now book issued member, a- book issue date, return date, actual return date checked-in status. These individual items also called attributes. Each attributes represents potential column table. At point, formulate questions as: How add information set fresh books supplied Library publisher? How maintain list members? What member leaves member wants change his/her address? How update information book returned member? What kind reports would want produce? Which books read among readers? And generate list books due returned members borrowed them? Now details, let us see divide information tables. We divide information items attributes major entities subjects. Each subject becomes table. So, preliminary list tables looks like image shown screen. The major subjects entities shown books members. Therefore, makes sense start two tables, one books one members. Let us look Books table detail. It 10 attributes columns defined earlier: Title, Author, Publisher, PublisherAddress, PublisherCity, PublisherPhone, PublishYear, Price, AuthorBirthDate AuthorCountry. Now, let us see data displayed table. Notice row record contains information book, author publisher. Now, two flaws design. There many books author publisher. So, notice author’s details publisher’s details repeated many times wastes computer disk space. And second problem design is: runs risk introducing anomalies database. Now, anomaly? It simply error inconsistency database. There three types anomalies: The first called insertion anomaly occur new record inserted. Or, certain attributes cannot inserted database without presence attributes. For example, suppose new Publisher called 'Penguin'. Now, design let us insert details Penguin publishers library get hold least one book them. The second called deletion anomaly occurs deletion record. Here, deletion row record database deletes information wished delete. For example, see 'Orient Publishers' one book titled ‘Paradise Lost’, library. Now, delete entire record lose information Orient Publishers. And lose information author John Milton well. And finally, let us see Update Anomaly is. It occurs updating record. For example, let us suppose Cambridge Publishers new address. Now, updating Address column Publisher requires us make change one place. In case, two places. And, Cambridge supplied thousand books means, need change address thousand records. And might accidentally change address one place forget change places. So, lead information accurate thereby data integrity lost. How solve problems? We redesign record fact once. If information repeated one place place information separate table. Let us see how. Now split Books table Books, Authors Publisher. Notice columns table store facts entity subject only. This way, record publisher information inside Publisher table. Similarly, separate Authors table allows recording author information once. And see link tables back Books table next tutorial. This brings us end tutorial first part Database Design LibreOffice. To summarize, learned following topics database design: * Determining purpose database *Finding organizing information required *Dividing information tables.
