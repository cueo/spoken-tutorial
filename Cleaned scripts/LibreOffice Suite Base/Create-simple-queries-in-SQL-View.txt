Welcome Spoken tutorial LibreOffice Base. In tutorial, learn to: * Create simple queries SQL View, write simple SQL. * Use SELECT, FROM WHERE clauses * And choose upper lower mixed cases naming fields tables . 00;27 Before using Base create queries SQL View, let us talk LibreOffice Base. Base runs HSQL database engine. This open source database engine software written Java. Go to: http://hsqldb.org information HSQLDB. Okay, let us learn SQL. SQL stands 'Structured Query Language'. It standard language accessing manipulating databases. It internationally accepted ANSI standard. And so, used variety 'Database Management Systems' 'DBMS'. 01;31 Some examples LibreOffice Base, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, Oracle DB2. The common use SQL retrieve data database also known querying database. SQL also used inserting data database, updating data deleting data database. And done operations using Base, previous tutorials, using user friendly wizards designing windows. But knowing underlying query language gives us flexibility power query database And SQL also used modify data also modify database table structures. Since tutorial cover SQL, useful tutorials websites. <pause>. HSQLDB user guides. They viewed online Or downloaded saved computer PDF file. Okay, let us learn SQL now. We open familiar Library database example. Let’s open 'Library' database. Now, let us click Queries list left panel click ‘Create Query SQL View’. Now see blank window titled Query Design type queries SQL. Let us write first simple query. And is: Get information books library. Simple.. Any retrieval needs use SELECT keyword. And so, write query as- SELECT * FROM Books. Here, Books table name. Notice capital 'B' books. We faithfully follow table column names used earlier. And '*' wild card. Here, means- get fields columns Books table. Now, let us execute run it. Click Edit menu click Run Query. 04;48 Now see top panel list records books. We save query query write give descriptive names. So, first simple query! Here tips: HSQLDB case sensitive Database object names tables column names. Meaning- Table name “Books” Capital 'B' “books” small 'b'. But, convenience use upper cases lower cases. For example: 'BOOKS' capital letters, 'members' small letters etc. But, using mixed cases easy read understand. For example: 'BooksIssued', capital 'B' 'I'. Or 'ReturnDate' capital 'R' 'D'. So, use table names column names way created. For SQL keywords like SELECT, use case mix cases. But, let us uniform usage better readability. In examples, use upper cases keywords. Now, onto next query. We type query new window overwrite previous query. For now, let us overwrite previous query. Let us retrieve specific columns Books table. SELECT Title, Author FROM Books. And run query. We also use Run Query icon file menu bar use keyboard shortcut F5. And records columns needed. Okay. Let us move on. Let us introduce conditions criteria query. We retrieve books published Cambridge. And so, query is: SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Publisher = 'Cambridge'. Notice introduced new keyword WHERE followed condition say 'Publisher' equals 'Cambridge'. Let us run query see books publisher 'Cambridge'. And so, number conditions criteria query. Let us write query two conditions. Let us retrieve books published Cambridge published year 1975. And query is: SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Publisher = 'Cambridge' AND PublishedYear > 1975. And see two conditions WHERE keyword clause. Notice put together using ‘AND’. Here ‘AND’ called logical operator serves combine conditions. ‘OR’ another logical operator. Explore using query later. Let us run query see results top. There, books met conditions. Okay, let us also learn another way include multiple conditions. How get list books publisher Cambridge Oxford both? And query: SELECT * FROM Books WHERE Publisher IN ( 'Cambridge', 'Oxford'). Notice new keyword ‘IN’. It helps combine conditions based single column- case, Publisher. And notice results now. Here assignment: Write test SQL queries following: 1. Get information members Library. 2. Get list book titles priced Rs 150. 3. Get list books written William Shakespeare John Milton. Let us learn SQL next tutorial. This brings us end tutorial Queries SQL View LibreOffice Base. To summarize, learned to: * Create simple queries SQL View. * Write simple SQL * Use SELECT, FROM , WHERE clauses * And choose upper, lower, mixed cases naming fields tables.
