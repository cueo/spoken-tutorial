Welcome Spoken tutorial LibreOffice Math. In tutorial, learn to: * Write matrix * Align equations particular character. For this, let us first open example Writer document created previous tutorials- "MathExample1.odt". Notice previous example formulae wrote using Math. Now, let us scroll last page document press Control, Enter go new page. Let us call Math clicking Insert menu, Object Formula. 0049: In mathematics, matrix rectangular array numbers symbols called elements. 'Math' separate mark represent matrix rows columns elements. I examples written already save time. I copy paste them. Now, we’ll learn write 2 3 matrix. This matrix 2 rows 3 columns. We use markup matrix include elements within curly brackets, Formula Editor window. Notice elements row separated one hash symbol rows separated two hash symbols. Use parentheses enclose matrix brackets. Now, notice brackets short cover elements matrix entirely. They size element hence scalable size matrix. To solve this, use words ‘Left’ ‘Right’. i.e. 'Left', open bracket 'Right', close bracket make brackets scalable. Let copy paste next example. So, 4 1 matrix look like shown screen. Notice scalable brackets Writer gray box. The markup matrix shown screen. Here, also use square brackets instead parentheses. So, using matrix mark up, write matrices dimensions. Now, let us write example matrix addition. Let us go new line Formula Editor window. We press Enter key twice add two blank lines. First, let us write two example 2 3 matrices, side side, shown screen. Next, let us add plus symbol two matrices denote addition. To this, simply click gap two matrices Writer Gray box. Notice cursor Formula Editor Window placed roughly two matrix mark ups here. Type plus (+) two matrices. So, plus symbol (+). Next, let us add equal symbol (=) end long gaps. And then, third matrix right, denoting addition. Notice used Greek characters example. So, result addition two matrices. Let us save work. Next, let us see example multiplying matrix number. We write 2 3 matrix multiply 4. We first write 4 times, followed matrix. Let copy matrix paste FEW. Next, let us write equal (=) symbol end long gaps followed matrix product. I copying pasting mark matrix product. So, product multiplying 2 3 matrix number. Now, format matrices clicking Format menu choosing Fonts, Font Size, Alignment Spacing. For example, let us choose Spacing. In Category drop-down, right, let us choose Matrices change Line spacing 20 percent column spacing 50 percent. Click OK. Notice, matrices elements well spaced out. Let us save work clicking File Save. Now, also use matrices write two three equations align particular character. For example, write simultaneous equations align equal character. Let us write set simultaneous equations now, shown screen. Notice perfectly aligned equal character. So, use matrix mark-up align them. We separate part equation treat parts elements matrix. Here, '2x' part, 'y' part, equal character part on. Press Enter twice. Copy paste mark up. And, thus new mark looks like shown screen. Here, used matrix mark up, treated part equation element separated # (hash) symbols. We used double hash symbols separate two equations. So, perfectly aligned set equations. Let us write another set equations. Here, let us suppose don’t equal number parts left right equal character. Notice equations screen aligned equal character. Let us rewrite mark align them. Press Enter twice. I copying pasting markup. So here, used alignr alignl align parts right left equal character. And, perfectly aligned set equations. Here assignment you: Write steps multiplying 2x3 matrix 3x1 matrix. Use formatting change font sizes spacing. Write set three equations. Align equations equal (=) character. This brings us end tutorial Matrix Aligning equations LibreOffice Math. To summarize, learned following topics: * Write Matrix * Align equations particular character.
