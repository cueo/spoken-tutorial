Welcome Spoken tutorial LibreOffice Math. In tutorial, learn to: * Write Set operations * Write Factorials * Cross reference equations numbering. For this, let us first open example 'Writer' document created previous tutorials "MathExample1.odt". Here, let us go end document press Control, Enter go new page. And type “Set Operations: ” press Enter twice. Now, let us call Math. Before go ahead, let us increase Font-size 18 point. Change Alignment Left. Let us learn write Set operations. Math separate mark represent Sets collections distinct elements. Let us write four (4) example sets, Formula Editor window, shown screen: Set A 5 elements, Set B, Set C, Set D elements each. Notice write brackets sets, use mark up: lbrace rbrace. Now, write set operations unions intersections. First, let us write union operation. The mark-up B union C read it; resulting set 1, 2, 6, 4 5 includes distinct elements sets. The markup intersection operation read it. The intersection includes common elements sets. So, result B intersection D 6. And also write: set C subset set A, every element 'C' set A. The mark C subset A. You learn write set operations exploring Elements window, clicking third icon there. Go View > Elements > Set Operations. Let us save work now. Click File > Save. Now, let us write Factorial functions. We designate numbers 1 3 three formulae going write shortly. These help cross reference anywhere within Writer document. Let us go new page clicking three times slowly, outside Writer gray box. Press Control, Enter. Type: “Factorial Function: ” press Enter twice. Now, know call Math. But, another way bring Math object Writer. For this, simply write ‘f n’ Writer document press F3. We seeing new Math object says E equal m c squared along number one (1), within parentheses, right. Meaning- cross reference formula number 1, anywhere document. We learn details later. For now, let us double-click Math object. And formatting. Font size 18 'Left' Alignment. Okay, let us write example Factorial. The mark ‘fact’ represents factorial symbol. So, let us overwrite existing formula ours: 5 Factorial = 5 4 3 2 1 = 120. Notice mark here. Let us write next formula new Math object here. For this, let us first click outside Writer gray box three times slowly. Press down-arrow key two three times go end page. And type ‘f n’ press F3 bring second Math object. Again, repeat formatting overwrite existing formula factorial definition: n factorial equal prod k = 1 n k. Notice mark-up ‘prod’ denotes product, similar sigma summation. Now, let us introduce third Math object like first two rewrite factorial definition two conditional formulae, shown screen. Notice mark ‘binom’ displays vertical stack two elements helps better alignment. Let us see cross reference formulae. For this, let us go new page type: "An example factorial provided here:" Now, let us click Insert menu Cross reference. In new pop-up, let us select Text Type list. Then choose first item Selection list denoting first factorial formula wrote. 07.21 Now choose Reference ‘Insert reference to’ list click Insert close. 07.31 So, number one (1) parentheses appeared next text. And done. 07.39 Let us test simply clicking number 07.43 notice cursor jumped location wrote first formula. 07.51 So, cross reference Math formulae anywhere within Writer document. 07.58 Let us save work. 08.01 Here reference links Math: Download Guide 'libreoffice.org documentation' link. You also visit following website information Math. And finally, assignment you. Use Writer document. Using example Sets tutorial: check A union ( B union C) equal (A union B) union C. Write results A minus B cross reference second third factorial formulae Writer document. This brings us end tutorial Sets, Factorials Cross Referencing LibreOffice Math. To summarize, learned to: * Write Set operations * Write Factorials * Cross reference equations numbering.
