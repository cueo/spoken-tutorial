Welcome Spoken tutorial LibreOffice Math. In tutorial, cover introduction Formula Editor LibreOffice Math. We learn following topics: * What LibreOffice Math? * System requirements using Math * Using Formula Editor * Writing simple formula. What LibreOffice Math? LibreOffice Math software application designed creating editing mathematical formulae. It bundled inside LibreOffice Suite hence open source, free cost free distribute. The formulae equations created using Math stand alone used documents LibreOffice Suite. The formulae embedded documents Writer Calc. Some examples formulae fractions, integrals, equations matrices. Let us look System requirements using Math. For Windows, need Microsoft Windows 2000 (Service Pack 4 higher), XP, Vista Windows 7; Pentium-compatible PC, 256 Mb RAM (512 Mb RAM recommended); For Ubuntu Linux, system requirements are: Linux kernel version 2.6.18 higher; Pentium-compatible PC, 512Mb RAM recommended. For complete information System requirements, visit LibreOffice website. If already installed LibreOffice Suite find Math LibreOffice Suite programs. If installed LibreOffice Suite download official website: In Linux, install synaptic package manager. I installed LibreOffice version 3.3.3. Okay, let us get started open 'Math' application. In Windows, go Start menu. Click All Programs >> LibreOffice Suite >> LibreOffice Math. Or, call inside LibreOffice Writer document. Let us click LibreOffice Writer open new text document. Now, Writer window, let us call Math. Let us click Insert menu main menu bar Object toward bottom click Formula. Now, see three areas Writer window. The first Writer area top. Here, notice small gray box. This equations formulae write, appear mathematical form. The second equation Formula Editor area bottom. Here, type mathematical formulae special markup language. And third Elements window floats right. If don’t see 'Elements' window, access clicking View menu choosing Elements. This window provides us range mathematical symbols expressions. If click outside gray box Writer area, Math windows disappear. Double-click gray box bring back Math Formula Editor Elements window. Ok.. let us write simple multiplication formula: 4 multiplied 3 equal 12. Now Elements window categories symbols top symbols bottom. Let us click top left icon. The tool tip, here, says Unary Binary Operators. And bottom, see basic mathematical operators plus, minus, multiplication division. Let us click b second row, denoting multiplication. Now, notice Formula editor window. It shows two place holders separated word "times". Also, Writer gray box area top, notice two squares separated multiplication symbol. Let us highlight first placeholder Formula editor double-clicking typing 4. Next, let us highlight second place holder type 3 Formula editor window. Notice Writer gray box refreshed automatically displays 4 3. We also click View menu top choose Update. Or, use keyboard shortcut F9 refresh window. Next, let us complete formula add equal 12 it. For this, let us click second icon says Relations, Categories section, Elements window. Notice various relation elements here. Let us select first one: equal b. And delete first place holder type 12 second place holder. And, first simple formula Writer area: 4 times 3 equal 12. Now learnt use Elements window write formula easy way. We also write formula right-clicking 'Formula Editor' window selecting symbols here. The context menu displays categories symbols Elements window. Choosing category, displays available symbols category. There third way writing formula. We directly write formula Formula Editor window. Here, use special mark-up-language 'Math' application understand. We already saw one simple example mark language. 4 times 3 equals 12. Notice word ‘times’ here. Similarly, write 4 divided 4 equals 1, mark : 4 4 equals 1. Now done, assignment you: In Writer window, write following formulae. 4 divided 4 = 1. Use ‘newline’ mark enter blank line formulae. Boolean AND b 4 greater 3 x approximately equal y And 4 equal 3. This brings us end tutorial LibreOffice Math- Introduction Formula Editor. To summarize, learned following topics: * What LibreOffice Math? * System requirements prerequisites using Math * Using Formula Editor * Writing simple formula.
