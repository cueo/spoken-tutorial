Welcome spoken tutorial Functions C C++. In tutorial learn, * What function * Syntax function *Significance return statement We examples. We also see common errors solutions. To record tutorial, I using, Ubuntu Operating System version 11.10, gcc g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 . Let us start introduction functions. A function self-contained program executing specific task. Every program consists one functions. Once executed, control returned back accessed. Let us see syntax function. ret-type defines type data function returns. fun_name defines name function. parameters list variable names types. We specify empty parameter list. This called functions without arguments. And called functions arguments. Let us see program using void. I already typed program editor. So I open it. Note file name function. And I saved file extension .c (dot c). Let explain code. This header file. Before using function, must defined. Here defined function called add. Note add function without arguments. And return type void. There two types functions- User-defined add function Pre-defined printf main function . Here initialized b assigning values 2 3. Here declared variable c. Then add values b. The result stored c. Then print result. This main function. Here call add function. The addition operation performed result printed. Now click Save. Let us execute program. Please open terminal window pressing Ctrl, Alt T keys simultaneously. To compile, type gcc function dot c hyphen o fun. To execute, type ./fun (dot slash fun). We see output displayed Sum b 5 . Now come back program. Functions contain special identifiers called parameters arguments. Let us see example arguments. I change things here. Type int add(int a, int b) Here declared function add. int int b arguments function add. Let us delete this. No need initialize b here. Delete printf statement. Type int main() Let us declare variable sum here. Type int sum; Then type sum = add(5,4); Here call add function. Then pass parameters 5 4. 5 stored 4 stored b. The addition operation performed. Let us print result. Hence type printf(“Sum %d\n”, sum); Delete this, already called function above. Type return 0; A non-void function must use return statement returns value. Click Save. Let us execute program. Come back terminal. Now compile program before. Let us execute. The output displayed Sum 9 . Now let us see execute program C++. Come back program. Let change things here. First press Shift, Ctrl S keys simultaneously. Now save file .cpp extension. Click Save. First change header file <iostream> We include using statement here. The function declaration C++. So need change anything here. Now replace printf statement cout statement, use cout<< function print line C++. We don't need format specifier \n here. Delete comma. Now, type two opening angle brackets. After sum , type two opening angle brackets. Within double quotes, type backslash n. Delete closing bracket. Now Click Save. Let us compile program. Come back terminal. Type g++ function dot cpp hyphen o fun1 Here fun1, don't want overwrite output file fun. Press Enter. Type ./fun1 The output displayed as: Sum 9 Now see common errors come across. Suppose here, type x place 4. I retain rest code is. Click Save. Let us compile program. We see error line no. 10. 'x' declared scope. This 'x' character variable. It declared anywhere. And add function integer variable argument. So, mismatch return type return value. Now come back program. Let us fix error. Type 4 line no. 10. Click Save. Let us execute again. Let clear prompt. Compile program before. Yes! It working. Now see another common error come across. Suppose pass one parameter. Delete 4. Click Save. Switch terminal. Let us compile. We see error line 10. arguments function 'int add (int, int)' Switch back program. You see two parameters int int b. And passing one parameter. Hence giving error. Let us fix error. Type 4. Click Save . Switch terminal. Let us execute again. Yes! It working. Come back slides. To summarize, tutorial learnt - *function *Syntax function *function without arguments Eg- void add() Function arguments Eg- int add(int a, int b) As assignment- Write program calculate square number.
