Welcome spoken tutorial Pointers C C++ . In tutorial learn: * Pointers * To create Pointers * And operations Pointers. We help example. To record tutorial, I using Ubuntu operating system version 11.10, gcc g++ compiler version 4.6.1 Ubuntu. Let us start introduction pointers. Pointers point locations memory. 00.38 Pointers store memory address. It also gives value stored address. Now, let us see example pointers. Note file name pointers_demo.c. Let us go code now. This header file stdio.h. This main() function. Here long integer num, assigned value 10. Then declared pointer ptr. Asterisk sign used declare pointer. This pointer point type long int. In 'printf' statement, ampersand used retrieving memory address variable. So, ampersand num (&num) give memory address num. This statement print address variable num. Over here, ptr stores address num. This statement print address ptr. sizeof() function give size ptr. This give value ptr. That memory address num. And asterisk ptr give value address. So, using asterisk give memory address. Instead give value. %ld format specifier long int. Now, let us execute program. Open terminal window pressing Ctrl, Alt T keys simultaneously keyboard. To compile, type gcc space pointers underscore demo dot c space hyphen o space point Press Enter. Type dot slash point. Press Enter. The output displayed. We see num address ptr value memory address num ptr different. Then size pointer 8 bytes. Also value pointed ptr 10 assigned num. Now let us see program C++. Note file name pointer underscore demo.cpp. Here changes like header file iostream. Then using std namespace. And cout function place printf() function. Rest things similar. Let us execute program. Come back terminal. To compile, type g++ space pointers_demo.cpp space hyphen o space point1, press Enter. Type dot slash point1, press Enter. We see output similar C program. This brings us end tutorial. Come back slide. Let us summarize. In tutorial, learnt: About pointer. To create pointer. And operation pointer. As assignment, write C C++ program declare variable pointer. Store address variable pointer. And print value pointer. Watch video available link shown below. It summarizes Spoken Tutorial project.
