Welcome spoken-tutorial Arrays C C++. In tutorial learn: * What array * Declaration array * Initialization array * Few Examples array. We also see common errors solutions. To record tutorial, I using Ubuntu Operating System version 11.04, gcc g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 . Let us start introduction Array. Array collection data elements data-type. Array index starts 0. The first element stored index 0. There three types arrays: Single dimensional array Two dimensional array Multi-dimensional array. We discussing single dimensional array tutorial. Let us see declare single dimensional array. The Syntax is: data-type name array size example, declared integer array 'star' contains 5 elements. The array index start star 0 star 4. We saw declaration array. Now, see initialization array. The Syntax is: data-type,( name array ), size equal elements example: declared 'integer array star' size 3. The elements array 1,2 3. Here index start star 0 star 2. Now, lets us move examples. I already typed program editor. So, let open it. Please note file name array.c In program, calculate sum elements stored array. Let explain code now. This header file. This main() function. Here, declared initialized array star size 3. The elements array 4, 5 6. Then declared 'integer variable' sum. Here add elements array store result sum. Note 4 stored index 0, 5 stored index 1 6 stored index 2. Then print sum. This return statement. Now, click Save. Let us execute program. Please open terminal window pressing Ctrl, Alt T keys simultaneously keyboard. To compile, type gcc space array dot c space hypen o array press Enter. To execute, type dot slash array (./array). Press Enter. Here output displayed as, The sum 15. Now let us see common errors come across. Come back program. Suppose, line number 4, miss curly brackets. Click Save. Let us see happens. Come back terminal. Let us compile before. We see error: Invalid initializer Expected identifier bracket numeric constant. This arrays must initialized within curly brackets. Come back program. Let us fix error. Type curly brackets line number 4. Now, click Save. Lets us execute. Come back terminal. Let us compile before. Let us execute before. Yes, working. Now execute program C++. Come back program. I change things here. First, press Shift , Ctrl S keys simultaneously keyboard. Now save file extension dot cpp (.cpp) click Save. Let us change header file iostream. Now include using statement. The declaration initialization array C++. Hence need change anything here. Now replace printf statement cout statement. Delete format specifier backslash n (\n), delete comma type two opening angle brackets. Delete bracket here. Again type two opening angle brackets within double quotes type backslash n (\n). Now, click Save. Let us execute. Come back terminal. To compile, type g++ space array dot cpp space hyphen o space array1 Here array1 don't want overwrite output parameter array file array dot c. Now press Enter. To execute type, dot slash array1(./array1) . Press Enter. The output displayed as: The sum 15 We see similar C code. Now, see another common error. Come back program. Suppose here, line number 7, I type star[1], star[2] star[3]; click Save. Let us execute. Come back terminal. Let clear prompt. Let us compile before. Let us execute before. We get unexpected output. This array index starts 0. Come back program. We see array index starts one. Hence giving error. Let us fix error. Type 0 1 2. Click Save. Let us execute. Come back terminal. Let us compile before. Execute before. Yes, working. Now, go back slides. Le us summarize. In tutorial learned: * Arrays * To declare Single Dimensional Arrays * To initialize Single Dimensional Arrays example int star[3]={4, 5, 6} To add elements array, example sum equal star 0 plus star 1 plus star 2. As assignment, write program calculate difference elements stored array. Watch video available link shown below. It summarizes Spoken Tutorial project. If good bandwidth, download watch it.
