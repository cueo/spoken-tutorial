Welcome spoken-tutorial Strings C C++. In tutorial learn: * What string. * Declaration string. * Initialization string. * Few examples string. We also see common errors solutions. To record tutorial, I using Ubuntu Operating System version 11.04, gcc g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 . Let us start introduction strings. String sequence characters treated single data item. Size string = length string + 1. Let tell declare string. The syntax char, name string size. char data type, name string string name, give size here. Eg: declared character string names size 10. Now see example. I already typed program, I open it. Note file name string.c In program, take string input user print it. Let explain code now. These header files. Here string.h includes declarations, functions, constants string handling utilities. Whenever work string functions, include header file. This main() function. Here declaring string strname size 30. Here accepting string user. To read string, use scanf() function format specifier %s. We using caret sign \n include spaces string. Then print string. And return statement. Now click Save. Let us execute program. Please open terminal window pressing Ctrl, Alt T keys simultaneously keyboard. To compile, type gcc space string.c space -o space str And press Enter . To execute, type ./str (dot slash str). Now press Enter. Here displayed Enter string . I type "Talk To A Teacher". Now press Enter. The output displayed The string Talk To A Teacher. Now let us switch back slides. Until discussed declaration string. Now going discuss initialize string. The syntax is, char var_name[size] = “string”; Eg: Here declared character string “names” size 10 string “Priya”" Another syntax is, char var_name[ ] = {'S', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g'} within single quotes. eg: char names[10] = {'P', 'r', 'i', 'y', 'a'} single quotes. Let show use first syntax example. Switch back Editor. We use example. First, press shift, ctrl keys simultaneously keyboard. Now save file name stringinitialize. Now click Save. We going initialize string. Hence, 5th line, type = within double quotes “Spoken-Tutorial”; Now, click Save . Now remove two lines, going print string. Click Save. Let us execute. Come back terminal. To compile, type gcc space stringinitialize.c space -o space str2 Here str2 don't want overwrite output parameter str file string.c. Now press Enter. To execute, type ./str2 The output displayed "The string Spoken-Tutorial". Now see common errors come across . Come back program. Suppose, type spelling string sting. Now click Save. Let us execute. Come back terminal. Now compile before. We see fatal error. sting.h: No file directory compilation terminated. Come back program. This compiler able find header file name sting.h . Hence giving error. Let us fix error. Type r here. Now click Save. Let us execute again. Come back terminal. Compile before, execute before. Yes, working! Now, let us see another common error. Come back program. Suppose, I type int place char. Now, click Save . Let us see happens. Come back terminal. Let clear prompt. Compile before. We see error. Wide character array initialized non-wide string . format %s expects argument type 'char' argument 2 type 'int' . Come back program. This used %s format specifier string. And initializing integer data type. Let us fix error. Type char here. Click Save. Let us execute. Come back terminal. Compile before, execute before. Yes, working! Now see execute program C++. Come back program. Let open file string.c. We edit code here. First, press shift, ctrl S keys simultaneously keyboard. Now save file extension .cpp (dot cpp). click Save. Now change header file iostream. Include using statement. Now click Save. Now delete declaration. And declare string variable. Type string space strname semicolon. Click Save. Replace printf statement cout statement. Delete closing bracket here. Delete scanf statement type getline opening bracket closing bracket, within brackets type (cin, strname) . At end, type semicolon. Now again, replace printf statement cout statement. Delete format specifier \n . Now delete comma. Type two opening angle brackets, delete bracket here. Type two opening angle brackets within double quotes type \n . And click Save. Here declared string variable 'strname' . Since use format specifier C++, compiler know 'strname' string variable. Here use getline extract characters input sequence. It stores string. Now let us execute program. Come back terminal. Let clear prompt. To compile, type g++ space string.cpp space -o space str3 press Enter. To execute, type ./str3 (dot slash str3). Press Enter. It displayed Enter string. I enter Talk To A Teacher . Now press Enter. The output displayed "The string Talk To A Teacher" We see output similar C code. Now come back slides. Let us summarize. In tutorial learnt: *Strings *Declaration string eg: char strname[30] *Initialization string eg: char strname[30] = “Talk To A Teacher” As assignment, write program print string using 2nd syntax.
