Welcome spoken-tutorial Structures C C++. In tutorial learn, * What Structure. * Declaration structure. We example. To record tutorial, I using Ubuntu Operating System version 11.10, gcc g++ Compiler version 4.6.1. Let us start introduction Structure . When one variables grouped one name, known structure. Structure used group different data one object. It called compound data-type. It used group related information together. Now see syntax declare structure. Here, keyword struct tells compiler structure declared. strcut_name name structure. eg. struct employee; You give name. Now see declare structure variable. The syntax is: struct struct_name struct_var; struct_var variable type struc_name. example, struct employee addr; addr variable type employee. Let us move example. I already typed program editor. So, let open it. Note file name structure.c. In program calculate total marks three subjects using structure. Let explain code now. This header file. Here declared structure student. Then declared three integer variables English, maths science. Variables defined structure called members structure. This main() function. Here declared integer variable 'total'. Now declared structure variable stud, stud variable type student, used access modify structure members. Here modified members assigning values 75, 70 65. Here calculate total three subjects. Then print result. This return statement. Now click Save . Let us execute program. Please open terminal window pressing Ctrl, Alt T keys simultaneously keyboard. To compile, type gcc space structure.c space hyphen o space struct press Enter. To execute, type (dot slash)./struct. Press Enter. The output displayed as: Total 210 Now execute program C++ . Come back program. I edit code. First press Shift, Ctrl S keys simultaneously keyboard. Now save file extension .cpp click save. Let's change header file iostream. Now include using statement click save. Structure declaration C++ C. So, need change anything here. At end replace printf statement cout statement. Delete format specifier (backslash n) \n. Now delete comma. Type two opening angle brackets. Here, delete closing bracket type two opening angle brackets. And within double quotes, type \n (backslash n). Now click Save. Let us execute program. Come back terminal. To compile, type g++ space structure.cpp space hyphen o space struct1 . Here struct1 don't want overwrite output parameters struct file structure.c . Now press Enter. To execute, type (dot slash) ./struct1. Press Enter. The output displayed as: Total 210 You see output C code. Now let us go back slides. We summarize now. In tutorial learned, * Structure * Syntax structure eg. struct struct_name; * To access members structure. Eg: stud.maths = 75; * And add structure variables. Eg: total = stud.eng + stud.maths + stud.science; As assignment, write program display records employee. Like name, address, designation, salary. Watch video available link shown below.
