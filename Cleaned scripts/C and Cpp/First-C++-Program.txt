Welcome spoken tutorial First C++ program. In tutorial I going explain, *How write C++ program *How compile *How execute We also explain common errors solution. To record tutorial, I using Ubuntu operating system version 11.10 G++ Compiler version 4.5.2 Ubuntu. To practice tutorial, You familiar Ubuntu Operating System Editor Some editors 'vim' 'gedit'. I using 'gedit' tutorial. For relevant tutorial please visit website shown. Let tell write C++ program example. Open terminal Window using Ctrl, Alt T keys simultaneously keyboard. To open text editor, type terminal. “gedit” space “talk” dot “.cpp” space ampersand “&” sign. We use “&” free prompt. Please note C++ files extension “.cpp”. Now Press Enter, text editor opened. Let us start write program. Type double slash “//” space “My first C++ program”. Here, double slash used comment line. Comments used understand flow program. It useful documentation. It gives us information program. The double slash called single line comment. Now press Enter. Type (hash) “#include”, space, opening angle bracket, closing angle bracket . It good practice complete brackets first, start writing inside it. Now Inside bracket, type “iostream” . Here iostream header file. This file includes declaration standard input output functions C++. Now press Enter. Type “using” space “namespace” space “std” semicolon “;” . The using statement informs compiler want use std namespace. The purpose namespace avoid name collisions. It done localizing names identifiers. It creates declarative region defines scope. Anything defined within namespace SCOPE namespace. Here std namespace entire standard C++ library declared. Now press Enter. Type “int” space “main” opening bracket, closing bracket . main special function. It denotes execution program begins line. The opening closing bracket called Parenthesis. Parenthesis followed main tells user main function. Here, int main() function takes arguments returns value type integer. We learn data types another tutorial. Now let us switch slides know main function. Every program one main function. There NOT one “main” function. Otherwise compiler cannot locate beginning program. The empty pair parentheses indicates main arguments. The concept arguments discussed upcoming tutorials. Now come back program. Press Enter. Type opening curly bracket “{”. The opening curly bracket marks beginning function main(). Then Type closing curly bracket “}”. The closing bracket indicates end function main(). Now, inside bracket press enter twice. Move cursor one line up. Indentation makes code easier read. It also helps locate errors faster. So let us give space here. And type “cout” space two opening angle bracket '. Here cout standard C++ function print output terminal. Now brackets, type within double quotes. Anything within double quotes, cout functions, printed. Now inside quote type“Talk teacher backslash n” (\n). Here \n signifies newline. As result, execution cout function, cursor moves new line. Every C++ statement must end semicolon. Hence type end line. Semicolon acts statement terminator. Now press Enter. Give space Type “return” space “0” semicolon “;”. This statement returns integer zero. An integer returned function function type int. The return statement marks end executable statements. We learn returned values another tutorial. Now click “Save” button save file. It good habit save files frequently. This protect sudden power failures. It also useful case applications crash. Let us compile program. Come back terminal. Type “g++” space “talk.cpp” space hyphen “-o” space “output”. Here g++ compiler used compile C++ programs. talk.cpp filename. hyphen -o output says executable go file "output". Now press Enter. We see program compiled. By typing ls space hyphen lrt, see output last file created. Let us execute program, type “./output” (dot slash output). And Press Enter. Here output displayed “Talk teacher”. Now let us see common errors come across. Switch back text editor. Suppose miss }(closing curly bracket) save file. Let us execute. Come back terminal. Now compile run program using command used before. We see error. We see error line no.7 talk.cpp file "expected curly bracket end input". Now Come back text editor . As I said before, closing curly bracket marks end function main Hence re-insert bracket here. Now Save file. Let us execute again. You recall previously entered commands using arrow key. That I now. Yes, working. I show another common error. Let us switch back text editor. Now, suppose missed std. Let us save file. Come back terminal . Let us compile . We see error line no.3 line no.6 talk.cpp file. That "expected identifier 'semicolon' " " 'cout' declared scope". As cout standard C++ library function. entire C++ library function defined std namespace . Hence giving error. Let us fix error. Come back Text editor. Type std here. Let us save it. Let us compile again. Yes, working. As assignment, write program print name city. We used single line comment tutorial. Now try give multiline comment. Watch video available link shown below.
