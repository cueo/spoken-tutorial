Welcome spoken-tutorial files C . In tutorial learn: * How open file. * How read data file. * How write data file. * Few examples. To record tutorial, I using Ubuntu Operating System version 11.10, gcc Compiler version 4.6.1. Let us start introduction files. File collection data. It database, program, letter anything. We create file access using C. Now let us see example file handling C. I written program. Let's take look. Note file name file.c In program create file write data it. Let explain code now. This header file. This main() function. To define file variable use type FILE. The FILE variable defined header stdio.h. *fp pointer FILE variable. It store information file , like name, status current information. Let us go back slides. Now see syntax open file. Here, fopen() function opens stream. Then links file stream. file name name file want open create. We give path along file name. And We also give extension. Here give mode file. Let us see types modes : "w" - creates file read write. "r" – opens file reading. "a" – writing end file. Now come back program. Here, create Sample.txt file write mode. We see path given. Our file created desktop. Then write statements file. "Welcome spoken-tutorial" "This test example". fprintf() writes output given output stream. fclose() closes file associated stream. And return statement. Now click Save. Let us execute program. Open terminal window pressing Ctrl, Alt T keys simultaneously keyboard. To compile, type gcc space file dot c space hyphen o space file Press Enter . To execute, type dot slash file (./file). Press Enter. We see file executed. Now check out. Let us open Home folder. Click Home folder option. Now click Desktop option. Here sample.txt file. This shows file successfully created. Now let us open. Double click file. We see messages here. Welcome Spoken Tutorial. This test example. This create file write data it. Now see read data file. I already made program. I open it. In program, read data sample.txt file print data console. Let explain code now. This header file. This main() function. Here, file variable pointer file variable defined. Then declared character variable c. Here, open file Sample.txt read mode. The output stored fp. Then check condition- "If fp equal NULL ". If condition true print message: "File doesn't exist." Else, check another condition- While c equal EOF. Here, EOF end file. It denotes end input. It condition data read data source. If condition true display characters Sample.txt file, console. Here, getc returns character specified file stream. Now, return character Sample.txt file. putchar used display character console. Then store characters variable c. Here close file. And return statement. Now click Save. Let us execute program. Come back terminal. To compile, type gcc space readfile dot c space hyphen o space read Now press Enter . To execute, type ./read (dot slash read). The output displayed as: Welcome Spoken-Tutorial. This test example. This brings us end tutorial. Come back slides. Let us summarize. In tutorial learnt: * File handling, * To write data file. eg. fp = fopen(“Sample.txt”, “w”); * To read data file. eg. fp = fopen(“Sample.txt”, “r”); As assignment- Write program create file TEST. Write name address file TEST. Then display console using C Program. Watch video available link shown below. It summarizes Spoken Tutorial project. If good bandwidth, download watch it.
