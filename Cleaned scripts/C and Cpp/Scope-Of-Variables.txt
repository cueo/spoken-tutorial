Welcome spoken tutorial Scope variables C C++. In tutorial learn, * What Scope variable? * What Global variable? * What Local variable? Few examples. We also see common errors solutions. To record tutorial, I using Ubuntu Operating System version 11.04, gcc g++ Compiler version 4.6.1. Let us start introduction scope variables. It region code within variable accessed. Depending it's type place declaration divided two categories: Global Variable & Local Variable. Now see example. I already typed program editor. Let open it. Note file name scope.c. Let explain code now. This header file. Here declared two global variables b. And initialized assigning values 5 2. A global variable available functions program. These declared outside functions, main() function. These global scope. Here declared function add without arguments. Here 'sum' local variable, declared inside function add. A local variable available function inside declared. These variables declared inside block. These local scope. Then sum & b stored variable 'sum'. Here print sum. This main() function. The add function called executed. And return statement. Now click Save. Let us execute program. Please open terminal window pressing Ctrl, Alt T keys simultaneously keyboard. To compile, type gcc space scope.c space hyphen o space sco press Enter. To execute, type ./sco (dot slash sco), press Enter. The output displayed Sum b 7. Now let us see execute program C++. Come back program. First press Shift, Ctrl & S keys simultaneously keyboard. Now save file extension .cpp (dot cpp) click Save. Let us change header file iostream. Now include using statement. Click save . The declaration global variable local variable C++. So, need change anything. Now replace printf statement cout statement. Delete format specifier '\n'. Now delete comma. Type two opening angle brackets. Delete closing bracket, type two opening angle brackets. And within double quotes type backslash n. Now click Save. Let us execute program. Come back terminal. To compile, type g++ space scope dot cpp space -o space sco1 Here sco1 don't want overwrite output parameter sco file 'scope.c'. Now press Enter. To execute type ./sco1 press Enter. The output displayed Sum b 7. We see similar C code. Now see common errors come across. Come back program. Suppose I declare variable again. Type int semicolon. Click Save. We declared variable 'a' main() function add function. Let us see happens. Come back terminal. Now compile before. We see errors, redefinition 'int a' , 'int a' previously defined here. Come back program. global variable. It global scope. We cannot declare variable twice already declared globally. We declare variable local variable . Let us fix error. Delete . Click Save. Let us execute again. Come back terminal. Now compile before, execute before. Yes, working. This brings us end tutorial. Let us summarize. In tutorial learnt , Scope variable, Global variable, e.g : int a=5 & local variable ,e.g:int sum As assignment, write program print difference two numbers. Watch video available link shown .
