Welcome spoken tutorial First C program. In tutorial, learn *How write simple C program *How compile *How execute We also explain common errors solutions. To record tutorial, I using Ubuntu operating system version 11.10 gcc Compiler version 4.6.1 Ubuntu. To practice tutorial, You familiar Ubuntu Operating System Editor. Some editors vim gedit. I use 'gedit' tutorial. For relevant tutorials please visit website shown. http://spoken-tutorial.org Let tell write C program example. Open terminal window pressing Ctrl, Alt T keys simultaneously keyboard. Now let's open text editor. So, prompt, type “gedit” space “talk” dot “c” space “&” sign. We use ampersand (&) free prompt. Please note C files extension “.c”(dot C). Now Press Enter, text editor opened. Let us start write program. Type double slash “//” space “My first C program”. Here, double slash used comment line. Comments used understand flow program. It useful documentation. It gives us information program. The double slash called single line comment. Now press Enter. Type (hash) “#include” space opening bracket , closing bracket. It always good practice complete brackets first, start writing inside it. Now Inside bracket, type“stdio” “(dot).” “h” . stdio.h header file. A program must contain header file uses standard input/output functions. Now press Enter. type “int” space “main” opening bracket, closing bracket. main special function. It denotes execution program begins line. The opening bracket closing bracket called parenthesis. Parenthesis followed main tell user main function. Here int main function takes arguments. It returns value type integer. We learn data types another tutorial. Now Let us switch slides know main function. Let us go next slide. Every program one main() function. There NOT one main function. Otherwise compiler cannot locate beginning program. The empty pair parentheses indicates main arguments. The concept arguments discussed detail upcoming tutorials. Now let us come back program. Press Enter. Type opening curly bracket “{”. The opening curly bracket marks beginning function main. Then Type closing curly bracket “}”. The closing curly bracket indicates end function main. Now Inside bracket press Enter twice, move cursor one line up. Indentation makes code easier read. It also helps locate errors faster. So let us give three space And Type “printf” opening bracket closing bracket “()” . printf standard C function print output terminal. Here, inside brackets, within double quotes. Anything within double quotes, printf statement, printed terminal. Type“Talk To Teacher backslash n”. Backslash n “\n” signifies newline. As result, execution printf function, cursor moves new line. Every C statement must end semicolon “;”. Hence, type end line. Semicolon acts statement terminator. Now press Enter give three space here. And type “return” space “0” semicolon. This statement returns integer zero. An integer returned function function type int. The return statement marks end executable statements. We learn returned values another tutorial. Now click on"Save" button save file. It good habit save files frequently. This protect sudden power failures. It also useful case applications crash. Let us compile program, come back terminal. Type “gcc” space “talk.c” space hyphen “-o” space “myoutput”, gcc compiler, talk.c filename . -o myoutput says executable go file myoutput. Now Press Enter. We see program compiled. By typing ls space (hypen) -lrt, see myoutput last file created. To execute program, type (dot slash)“./myoutput” , press Enter. Here output displayed “Talk To Teacher”. As I said before, return last statement executed. Thus, return statement nothing executed. Let us try out. come back program. After return statement, let us include one printf statement, give space here, type printf opening bracket, closing bracket. Inside bracket within double quotes type Welcome backslash n , end type semicolon. Now click save. Let us compile execute come back terminal. recall previously entered commands using arrowkey. That I now. We see second statement welcome executed. Now come back program. Let us write 'Welcome' statement return statement. Click Save. Let us compile execute. We see second printf statement welcome also executed. Now let us see common errors come across. Come back program. Suppose I miss dot “stdio.h”, click Save. Let us compile execute . We see fatal error line no.2 talk.c file. The compiler cannot find header file name “stdioh”. Hence giving error "no file directory". And compilation terminated. Let us fix error come back program. Reinsert dot “.”, click Save. Let us compile execute. Yes, working. I show another common error. Let us switch back program. Now, suppose I miss semicolon end line. Click Save. Let us compile execute. We see error line no.6 talk.c file. "expected ';' (semicolon) 'printf'". Come back program. As I said before, semicolon acts statement terminator. So search end line.5 beginning line.6. This line 6. This last place put semicolon. Recall compiler also gives error message line 6. Let us try happens put semicolon here. Click Save . Let us Compile execute. Yes, working. Now come back program. Let us type semicolon end line conventional practice type semicolon end line. Now click Save. Let us Compile execute. Yes working. Now let us go back slides. As Assignment Write program print "Welcome World C" See happens “\n” included printf statement. This brings us end tutorial.
