Welcome Spoken Tutorial Typedef Union C. In tutorial, learn about: typedef keyword union keyword help examples. For tutorial, I using: Ubuntu Operating System version 11.10. gcc compiler version 4.6.1 Ubuntu. To follow tutorial, familiar 'C' tutorials. If not, relevant tutorials, please visit website shown. I start introduction typedef keyword. Typedef keyword used give symbolic name existing type user-defined datatypes. It way define alias commands. It helps provide clarity code. It makes code easier understand change. Syntax: typedef existing_name alias_name. Example: typedef unsigned int uint; Let us go example code. Note filename "pallindrome.c". In program, check whether given number palindrome not. We given alias name 'uint' unsigned int datatype , using typedef keyword. Here using 'uint' declare variables. This logic palindrome. Now, let us execute program. Open terminal pressing Ctrl+Alt+T keys simultaneously keyboard. Type: gcc space pallindrome dot c space hyphen o space pallindrome. Press Enter. Type: dot slash pallindrome We see: "Enter three digit number:". I enter 121. The output is: Given number palindrome number. Now learn union datatype. union collection different datatypes grouped together. union allocates one common storage-space members. We access one member union time. Syntax1: union union_name within curly brackets members; curly brackets union_variable semicolon. We also alternate syntax. Syntax 2: union union_name within curly brackets members; curly brackets semicolon union union_name union_variable; Let us see example. I code file; let us go it. Note filename union dot c. We declared union named student. Here, three variables- english, maths science. In main() function, declared union variable stud. Here access union members using union variable: stud dot english stud dot maths stud dot science Then calculate total marks display it. Let us execute terminal. Type: gcc space union dot c space hyphen o space union Type: dot slash union The output displayed as: Total 228. Let us see difference structure union. union allocates common storage-space members. structure allocates separate storage-space members. union occupies lower memory space. structure occupies higher memory space. Example union: union student{int marks;char name[6];double average;}; Memory allocation union variable 8 bytes double datatype occupy maximum memory space. Example structure: struct student{int mark;char name[6];double average;}; Memory allocation structure variable be: 2bytes+6bytes+8bytes =16bytes. This brings us end tutorial. Let us summarize. In tutorial, learnt: typedef union Difference union structure. As assignment, write program display records employee like name, address, salary. Define union named employee. Give alias name "emp" using typedef. Watch video available link shown below. It summarizes Spoken Tutorial project. If good bandwidth, download watch it.
