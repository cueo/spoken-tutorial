Welcome spoken tutorial Nested loop BASH. In tutorial, learn Nested loop help example. To record tutorial, I using Ubuntu Linux 12.04 Operating System GNU BASH version 4.1.10 Please note, GNU Bash version 4 recommended practice. To learn tutorial, familiar loops Bash. For relevant tutorials, please visit website shown- http://spoken-tutorial.org Let us start introduction nested loop. A loop within loop known nested loop. Let us see syntax. Outer loop expression 1, 2, 3; inner loop expression 1, 2, 3; statement 1, statement 2 closing inner loop, closing outer loop. Let us see example nested loop. First, let us go directory structure. Here directory Desktop named simple-nested-for. Let's open it. We sub-directories "test", "test2", "test3" Bash script. In sub-directory, multiple text files. Now move code. This program displays files within sub-directory. Please note achieved single line command ls -1 (hyphen one) -R(hyphen R) test*(test asterisk). But using loop. Note name Bash script nested-(hyphen)for dot sh. This shebang line. This outer loop. This loop check directories starting name test. First echo line display sub-directories name. The second echo line create blank line. This inner loop. It check files present within directories. "ls" displays directory content. -1 (hyphen one) used list one file per line.

Type: chmod plus +x nested-(Hyphen)for dot sh Press Enter. Type: dot slash nested-(Hyphen)for dot sh Press Enter. The output displayed. It shows files test directory, files test2 directory files test3 directory. This brings us end tutorial. Let us summarize. In tutorial, learned Nested loop.
