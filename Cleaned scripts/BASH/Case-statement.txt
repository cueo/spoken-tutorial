Dear friends, welcome spoken tutorial Case statement Bash. In tutorial, learn: Importance case statement Syntax case statement example. To follow tutorial, knowledge basics Shell scripting. If not, relevant tutorials, please visit website shown. For tutorial, I using: Ubuntu Linux 12.04 Operating System GNU BASH version 4.1.10 Please note, GNU Bash version 4 recommended practice tutorial. The Bash shell two forms conditional statements- 'if' statement 'case' statement. Case statement alternately used place if-else statement. The case statement preferred many items select from. It usually used implement menus script. Let us see syntax. case space $(dollar) VARIABLE space match_1 close round-bracket space commands semicolon twice match_n close round-bracket space commands semicolon twice asterisk close round=bracket space command_to_execute_by_default semicolon twice esac. The VARIABLE compared match_1. If match, moves next case match_n. It check one strings matches VARIABLE. If 'yes' commands double semicolon (;;) executed. If neither match VARIABLE, commands associated asterisk executed. It default case condition asterisk match strings. esac marks end case block. Let us understand case statement example. I already typed program. So, I open file case.sh. The program prints warning message disk space reaches certain limit. This shebang line. The location bash different Linux flavors like CentOS, RedHat etc. Previously used /bin/bash points directly binary file. env used here, abstracts true location bash located. This shebang line improves portability script GNU/Linux system. df -(hyphen)h displays disk space usage human readable form. The output piped sort -rk5 sorts fifth column reverse order. The output passed awk 'FNR == 2 {print $5}' extracts fifth field second line. Eventually, output passed cut -(hyphen)d “% -(hyphen)f1” strip % sign. This first line case statement. Here, compare space 0 69. If match found, prints "Everything OK” Next, compares space 70 89 91 98. If match found, prints “Clean out. There's partition $(dollar)space % full.” Here, compares space 99. If match found, prints “Hurry. There's partition $(Dollar) space %!” This default case condition asterisk match strings. And end case statement. Now, go terminal make file executable. Type: chmod plus x case dot sh Type: dot slash case dot sh "Everything OK". Note output vary depending system disk space. In machine, match found 0 69, prints "Everything OK". Check message printed machine. You able understand case statement executed. This brings us end tutorial. Let us summarize. In tutorial, learned: Importance case statement Syntax case statement disc-space example. As assignment: Write menu driven program mathematical calculation- * It take user inputs 'a' 'b'; * It ask mathematical operator (plus +, minus -, division / multiplication *). * Do calculation * print output.
