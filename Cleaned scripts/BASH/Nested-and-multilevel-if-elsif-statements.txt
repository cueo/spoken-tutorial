Dear friends, welcome spoken tutorial Nested multilevel statement BASH. In tutorial, learn about: Nested if-else Multilevel if-else statement. We using examples. To follow tutorial, You familiar Linux Operating System. If not, relevant tutorials, please visit website shown. For tutorial, I using Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS GNU Bash version 4.1.10 GNU Bash version 4 recommended practice. Let us understand flow Nested if-else statement. Here, condition 1 True condition 2 evaluated, condition2 True statement 1 executed. That means, conditions 1 2 True statement 1 executed. If condition1 False, statement 3 executed. And, condition 2 False statement 2 executed. Let's see example. I written code file nestedifelse.sh. I open it. Let explain code now. This shebang line. The variable NAME assigned value anusha. The variable PASSWORD assigned value "abc123". The read command reads one line data standard input. '- (hyphen) p' flag displays prompt. The string - (hyphen) p, “Enter name: ” displayed terminal. myname variable stores text entered user i.e. user input. The first statement compares two variables myname NAME i.e. user input value stored variable Name i.e. "anusha". If two values match rest code statement evaluated. The read command reads stores entered password variable mypassword. Here, '- (hyphen) s' flag silent mode. It means, text entered user displayed terminal. Here, another set if-else statements. This set if-else statements nested within first . The second statement compares variables mypassword PASSWORD. echo displays message “Welcome” terminal condition True i.e. passwords match. '-e' enables interpretation backslash escape. '\n' stands new line means string Welcome” printed new line. When condition True else condition executed i.e. passwords don't match, else condition executed. In case, echo displays “Wrong password”. fi ends inner if-else statement. Coming back first if-else statement- values myname NAME don't match else statement executed. This echo message “Wrong Name” terminal. fi ends outer if-else statement. Now, open terminal window pressing ctrl+alt keys simultaneously keyboard. Make file executable. Type: chmod space plus x space nestedifelse.sh Type: dot slash nestedifelse.sh The program verifies two conditions i.e Name Password executed terminal. Here, prompt displays Enter Name: Let us type "anusha". As condition True, next condition evaluated. Now prompt says Password. I type password "abc123". The password matches value variable PASSWORD. So, prompt displays message Welcome. Now let us execute script again. Press 'up-arrow' key. Go dot slash nestedifelse.sh Press Enter. This time, enter name different password. So, I enter name "anusha" password "123". The name values match password values won't. So, message Wrong passwordwill displayed. This proves nested else statement within first statement executed. Let's execute script more. This time, give name "swati". The message “Wrong name” displayed. This name "swati" match previously declared value "anusha". The control comes first statement executes else statement. This prints message Wrong name. Now let us look multilevel if-else statement. If condition1 True statement1 executed. If condition1 False condition 2 evaluated. If condition2 True statement 2 executed . And condition 2 False condition N evaluated. If condition N True statement N executed. And Condition N false statement X executed. Let's look example. I working example. I open it. Note file name multilevel hyphen ifelse dot sh. Let us go code. This shebang line. mystring variable stores word, input user, execution. The condition checks whether input string null. '- (hyphen) z' checks whether length string zero. Type: man test terminal explore various string comparison. This echo statement printed nothing entered. The first elif condition checks whether input string contains "raj". If echo statement printed. The wildcard character ensures word "raj" it, identified. The next elif condition checks whether input string contains word "jit". If echo statement printed. The else condition executed conditions fail. And display message Sorry! Input contain either 'raj' 'jit'. fi indicates end multilevel if-else statement. Let us execute program. Come back terminal. Type: chmod space plus x space multilevel hyphen ifelse dot sh Type dot slash multilevel hyphen ifelse dot sh We prompted input. Let us give different inputs see happens time. First I press Enter without typing anything. The message Nothing Entered displayed. And control comes multilevel if-else statement. Let clear prompt. Let us try executing script different input. Press 'up-arrow' key. Go dot slash multilevel hyphen ifelse dot sh. Press Enter. The prompt displays "Enter Word". I type "abhijit". The output displayed is: “abhijit" contains word 'jit'. This shows control flowed third condition code. The first two conditions match. The logic applicable conditions. Try executing program different inputs check results. Let us summarize. In tutorial, learned usage of: Nested if-else: Name Password verification Multilevel if-else: String comparison program. As assignment, write program output different messages number * greater 3 * lesser 3 * equal 3 user input empty. Watch video available link shown below. It summarizes Spoken Tutorial project.
