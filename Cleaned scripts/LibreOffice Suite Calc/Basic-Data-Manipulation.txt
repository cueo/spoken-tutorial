Welcome Spoken tutorial LibreOffice Calc – Basics Data Manipulation. In tutorial, learn about: * Introduction basics Formula * Sorting Columns * Basics Filtering Data. Here, using Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 operating system LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4. Let us begin tutorial learning basic formulas used LibreOffice Calc. Formulas equations use numbers variables get result. In spreadsheet, variables cell locations hold data needed equation completed. The basic arithmetic operations performed addition, subtraction, multiplication division. Let us open “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” file first. In “personal finance tracker.ods” file, let us see add cost expenses mentioned heading, “Cost”. We shall give one heading “SUM TOTAL”, “Miscellaneous”. And shall click cell A8 give serial number “7”. Now, let's click cell number “C8” want display total costs. In order add costs, we’ll type: equal SUM within braces range columns added, is, C3 colon C7. Now, press Enter keyboard. You see items “Cost” get added. Now, let's learn subtract Calc. If want subtract cost “House Rent” “ Electricity Bill” display cell referenced A9, simply click 'A9' cell first. Now, cell, type equal within braces respective cell references, is, C3 minus C4. Press Enter key keyboard. We see cost two cell references get subtracted result displayed cell number 'A9'. Let's undo changes. Similarly, one divide multiply data different cells. Another basic operation spreadsheet finding average numbers. Let us see implemented. Let's give heading “Average” “SUM TOTAL” cell. Here, want display average total cost. So, let's click “C9” cell. Now type: equal Average Cost within braces. Press Enter key keyboard. You see average “Cost” column gets displayed cell. Let's undo changes. Similarly, find average elements horizontal row. We learn formulae operators advanced level tutorials. Let us learn sort data Calc spreadsheet. Sorting arranges visible cells sheet desired manner. In Calc, sort data using three criteria applied one another. They handy searching particular item become even powerful filtered data. Let's say, want sort data heading “Costs”, ascending order. So, first, highlight cells sorted clicking cell “Cost”. Now holding left mouse button, drag along column till end cell says “2000”. This selects column want sort. Now, click Data option menu bar click Sort. Next, select Current Selection. You see dialog-box appears tabs “Sort criteria” “Options”. In “Sort criteria” tab, select Cost “Sort by” field. In order sort “Cost” ascending order, click Ascending option next it. Now, click OK button. You see column gets sorted ascending order. Similarly, sort descending order, click Descending click OK button. Let us Undo changes. Multiple columns sorted first selecting columns applying sort options. Let's say, want sort serial numbers well cost. So, first select columns earlier. Now, click Data option menu bar click Sort. In dialog-box appears, first select “Cost” “Sort by” field. Then select “SN” “Then by” field. Click Descending options near click OK button. You see headings get sorted descending order. Let's Undo changes. Now, let's learn filter data LibreOffice Calc. A filter list conditions entry meet order displayed. In order apply filter spreadsheet, let's click cell named “Item”. Now, click “Data” option menu bar click “Filter”. Click “AutoFilter” option pop-up menu. You see arrow mark appears headings. Click down-arrow cell named “Item”. Now, suppose want display data related “Electricity Bill”.. So, click “Electricity Bill” option. You see data related “Electricity Bill” displayed sheet. The rest options filtered out. In order view data, click downward arrow cell named Item click “All”. We see able view data originally written. Apart “AutoFilter”, two filter options namely “Standard Filter” “Advanced Filter” learn later stages series. This brings us end Spoken Tutorial LibreOffice Calc: To summarize, learned about: * Introduction basics formula * Sorting columns * Basics filtering data. Watch video available following link.
