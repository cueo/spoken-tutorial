Welcome to this spoken tutorial on Globbing and Export command.

 00:06
In this tutorial, we will learn about:

 00:08
* Globbing

 00:09
* export command.

 00:11
 To follow this tutorial, You should be familiar with Linux Operating System.

 00:18
If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our  website which is as shown.

  00:24
For this tutorial, I am using:

  00:27
* Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS and

  00:31
* GNU Bash version 4.1.10

  00:35
 Please note, GNU Bash version 4 or above is recommended to practice this tutorial.

  00:43
  Let us start with an introduction to globbing.

  00:46
 Filename or pathname expansion carried by BASH is known as Globbing.

  00:52
 Globbing recognizes and expands wildcards.

  00:57
 It also interprets standard wildcard characters like-

  01:02
 # *  (asterisk) and

   01:04
# ? (Question mark).

 01:05
 Let us understand this with the help of an example.

  01:09
Open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl+Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

  01:18
On the Terminal, type: ls space asterisk dot sh press Enter.

 01:27
It matches all the files having ".sh" extension in the present directory.

 01:34
Here, we can see that all the sh files are listed.

 01:40
Let me clear the prompt. Now type: ls space s asterisk dot sh press Enter.

  01:51
 We can see that s asterisk dot sh matches all the files starting with character s and having "sh" as  extension.

 02:02
 Let's move on ...

  02:04
 Now, type: ls space opening square bracket a hyphen c closing square bracket asterisk dot sh press Enter.

 02:19
 This will match and display the files starting with letter 'a' or 'b' or 'c.'

  02:26
 Observe the output.

  02:28
We see a list of all files starting with character 'a' or 'b' or 'c.'

  02:35
And these files have "sh" extension.

 02:39
Now, let's go ahead and type: ls space opening square bracket caret-sign a hyphen c closing square bracket asterisk dot sh press Enter.

 02:55
 This will match all the file-names with extension "sh"

 03:00
but will omit those starting with character as 'a' OR 'b' OR 'c'.

  03:07
 Observe the output. You will notice that the file names are not starting with character 'a', 'b' or 'c'.

  03:16
Let me clear the prompt.

  03:19
 Now type: ls space opening square bracket capital 'A'  small 'a' closing square bracket asterisk-sign dot sh press Enter.

 03:34
 This will match file names starting with upper and lower case of letter 'A'.

 03:40
 See the output. All file names starting with upper and lower case 'A' and extension "sh" are listed.

 03:49
 Now let's see the Export command in BASH.

 03:53
 Switch to our slides.

 03:55
 In Bash, variables are local to their own Shell.

 04:00
 Local variables can be used by same Shell  or by the current Shell.

 04:06
 Export command-
 exports a variable or a function to the environment of all child processes.


 04:15
 * Can also change a local variable to a global variable.

 04:20
 We will try to understand this with an example.

  04:24
 Switch to our Terminal,  type: myvar equal to sign lion press Enter.

  04:34
 Now type: echo space dollar-sign myvar press Enter.

  04:41
lion is printed.

 04:44
This is the value assigned to the variable myvar.

 04:48
Now, let's navigate to a new Shell.

 04:51
 To go to a new Shell, we can either open a new Terminal or type: slash bin slash bash press Enter.

 05:03
 Now, let's check the value in the variable myvar.

 05:07
 Type: echo space dollar-sign myvar press Enter.

 05:15
 An empty line is printed.

 05:17
This means that the value assigned to variable myvar  was not transferred to this Shell.

 05:24
Also, the variable myvar  is  local only to the previous Shell and not to the current Shell.

  05:32
We will type exit to get back to our previous Shell.

 05:36
 So, to declare variables globally, we have to use the export command. 

 05:43
 Let's learn how.

 05:46
 Type: export space myvar equal to sign lion  press Enter.

 05:55
 Now type: echo space dollar sign myvar press Enter.

 06:02
lion  is displayed.

 06:05
 Let's navigate to another Shell.  Type: slash bin slash bash press  Enter.

 06:13
 Let me clear the prompt.

  06:15
  Now type: echo space dollar-sign myvar.

 06:22
 lion is displayed

 06:25
 This is because we have declared the variable myvar globally using the export command.

 06:33
 This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

 06:36
 Let us summarize. Come back to our slides.

  06:39
   In this tutorial, we learnt:

  06:41
 * Globbing

  06:42
* Export command.

 06:44
 As an assignment,

 06:45
 Write a Bash script to do all the operations discussed under globbing.
