   Dear friends, welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Logical Operators in Bash.

   00:07
  In this tutorial, we will learn use of:

   00:10
* Logical AND
 Logical OR
 Logical NOT

using a few examples. 

  00:19
   To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of:

  00:22
* if-else statement
 command line arguments and 
 quoting in BASH.


  00:30
 If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown.

  00:36
  For this tutorial, I am using:

  00:38
 * Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS

  00:43
 * GNU Bash version 4.1.10

  00:47
 GNU Bash version 4 or above is recommended for practice.

    00:53
  Let us understand the use of  Logical-operators.

    00:57
 Logical operators are mainly used to control program flow.

    01:02
 Logical operators help to link two expressions or conditions.

   01:09
 They can be a part of if, while or some other control statements.

   01:15
  Let's see the syntax of logical AND.

   01:19
 Opening square-bracket space dollar symbol condition1 space closing square-bracket space ampersand ampersand space opening square-bracket space dollar symbol condition2 space closing square-bracket.

   01:38
  Or we can use this syntax-

   01:41
  Opening square-bracket space dollar symbol condition1 space hyphen-a space dollar symbol condition2 space closing square-bracket.

   01:53
 Logical AND returns True when both condition1 and condition2 are True.

  02:00
  Let us see the syntax of Logical OR.

  02:04
 Opening square-bracket space dollar symbol condition1 space closing square-bracket space vertical bar again vertical bar space opening square-bracket space dollar symbol condition2 space closing square-bracket.

  02:22
 Or we can use this syntax-

  02:24
 Opening square-bracket space dollar symbol condition1 space hyphen-o space dollar symbol condition2 space closing square-bracket.

  02:36
 Logical OR returns  True when either condition1 or condition2 is True.

  02:43
  Let us learn the usage of  Logical OR and Logical AND using an example.

   02:50
  I have already typed the code in a file named logical.sh.

   02:55
  Open the terminal by pressing ctrl+alt and t keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

  03:04
 Type: gedit space logical.sh space ampersand sign, press Enter.

  03:12
 Now type the code as shown here, in your "logical.sh" file.

 03:18
 Let me explain the code now.

  03:21
  This is the shebang line.

 03:25
   The read command reads one line of data from  standard input.

 03:29
 - (hyphen) p displays the prompt.

 03:33
 string is a variable which stores the text entered by the user, during execution.

   03:39
    The if statement checks whether the entered string is empty.

  03:45
 - (hyphen) z checks whether length of string is zero.

    03:50
    Type: man space test on  terminal to explore various other string comparisons.

  03:57
  The echo statement will print a message if nothing was entered.

 04:02
  If the string is not empty, the program will move to the first elif statement.

 04:08
 Here, it checks whether the entered string contains both the words  "raj" and  "jit".

 04:16
 If yes, then it echoes out a message.

 04:20
 Please note that logical AND is used here.

 04:24
 Hence, the message will be displayed only when both the conditions are satisfied.

  04:31
 If that is not so then the program will move onto the second elif statement.

 04:37
 Here, it checks whether the entered string contains either "raj" or "jit".

 04:43
 If 'yes' then it displays the message.

 04:47
 Please note that logical OR is used here.

 04:52
 The message will be displayed only when any one of the conditions are satisfied.

  04:59
  Lastly, we have the default else statement.

 05:02
 When all the above statements are False then this statement will be executed.

  05:08
 "fi" is the end of multilevel if-else loop.

  05:12
 Let us execute the program.

  05:15
 Switch back to the terminal.

  05:17
 First make the file executable by typing- chmod space plus x space logical dot sh press Enter.

  05:30
 Now type: dot slash logical.sh press Enter.

  05:36
 The prompt displays "Enter a word:" 

  05:38
 I will enter "jitinraj" .

  05:42
 The output is: "jitinraj contains both the words 'raj' and 'jit' ".

  05:48
 This means that the control was passed to the second statement.

  05:52
 And as both the conditions are satisfied, it displays the message.

  05:57
  Now, let us execute the script again.

  06:00
 Press the up-arrow key.

  06:02
 Go to ./logical.sh  press Enter.

 06:07
  The prompt displays "Enter a word:"

 06:09
 This time I will enter "abhijit".

 06:13
 The output is displayed as: "abhijit contains the word 'raj' or 'jit'".

  06:19
  Please try executing the program with different inputs and observe the output.

  06:25
  Let's switch back to our slides.

  06:27
  Let's have a look at logical NOT operator.

  06:31
  It inverts the Boolean value of an expression

  06:35
  which means, it returns True if the expression is False

  06:40
  and returns False if the expression is True.

   06:44
  The syntax of logical NOT operator is-

  06:48
 Exclamation mark space expression

  06:52
 or  opening square-bracket space exclamation mark space expression space closing square-bracket.

  07:00
   Let us see an example.

  07:03
 I have already typed the code in a file.

  07:05
 So, I will go to the terminal  and type: gedit space logicalNOT dot sh space ampersand sign, press  Enter.

  07:18
  Now type the code as shown here, in your logicalNOT dot sh file.

 07:24
   This is the  shebang line as we already know.

  07:28
 $1 is the first command line argument passed to the script.

  07:33
 - (hyphen) f checks if the file exists with the same name that was passed as an argument.

  07:41
 So, it will return True if the file exists and False if it does not exist.

  07:48
  This NOT operator here, inverses the returned value

  07:52
 which means, if a file of that name exists, the condition will be True.

  07:58
 But the NOT operator will inverse its value to False.

  08:02
 And it will display the message "FILE does not exist".

   08:07
 Here, in the else statement, it displays the message  FILE exists.

 08:13
 "fi" marks the end of if loop.

  08:16
  Now , switch to the terminal.

  08:18
 Let me clear the prompt.

  08:20
 Let's create an empty file with the name test.txt.

  08:25
 TypeÂ : touch space test dot txt press Enter.

 08:32
  Next, make the script executable by typing:
chmod space plus x space logicalNOT dot sh press Enter.

 08:45
 Now, type: dot slash logicalNOT dot sh space test dot txt press  Enter.

 08:55
  Our shell script will check whether the file exists.

 09:00
 Our file test dot txt  exists,  hence the value will be True.

 09:07
 Then the logical NOT will inverse that value and return False.

 09:12
 Because the evaluation is False, the else statement is evaluated.

  09:18
   And the message displayed is -File 'test.txt' exists.

  09:23
 Try executing the program again with argument test1.txt.

  09:29
 And observe the control flow as explained before.

 09:33
  Come back to our slides.  Let us summarize.

 09:37
 In this tutorial, we learned the usage of:
 logical AND
 logical OR and
 logical NOT.


 09:45
   As an assignment,

 09:47
 check whether the file exists

 09:49
  and is executable

 09:51
 using logical operators   explained in this tutorial.

 09:56
 (Hint: man space test)
