Dear friends, welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Introduction to BASH shell scripting.

00:08
In this tutorial, we will learn:

 00:10
* About different types of Shells

 00:13
* To write a Bash Shell script and

 00:16
* To execute it.

00:18
 To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with Linux Operating System.

00:25
If not, then for relevant Linux tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown.

 00:32
 For this tutorial, I am using:

 00:35
* Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS and

 00:39
GNU Bash version 4.1.10.

 00:43
 Please note, GNU Bash version 4 or above is recommended for practice.

00:50
 Let us start with an introduction.

00:53
We will see what a Bash Shell is.

 00:56
 Bash Shell is a command language interpreter that executes commands.

 01:02
 These commands are read from the standard input device.

 01:07
 The input device can be-

01:09
 your keyboard

01:11
 or a simple text file.

 01:14
 Let me show you what is a Bash Shell.

 01:16
 Open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl+Alt+T keys simultaneously on your keyboard .

01:24
This will open the Gnome terminal.

01:27
To check which type of  shell we are using, type:  echo space dollar sign SHELL (in capital).

01:38
Press Enter.

01:40
 You will see the output printed on the next line as:  slash bin slash bash.

01:47
This indicates that we are using the Bash Shell.

01:51
 Now, let us know different types of  Shells available.

01:56
Let us switch back to our slides. Bourne Shell-

02:00
* This was original UNIX shell written by Stephen Bourne.

02:06
* It lacked interactivity provided by most modern shells today.

 02:11
 C Shell-

02:12
It provides features lacking in Bourne Shell .

 02:16
 K Shell-

 02:17
* It was created by David Korn.

 02:20
* It has features of both, B Shell and C Shell along with some additional features.

 02:27
 Bash Shell-

 02:30
* The Bash Shell was developed by GNU Project.

 02:32
* It is based on B Shell language.

02:35
* It has features of C and K Shells.

 02:40
 TC Shell-

 02:41
 It is the default Shell of FreeBSD and its descendants.

 02:46
 Z shell-

02:49
* It is a Shell designed for interactive use.

 02:52
* It has many useful features of ksh, bash and tcsh.

 02:58
Now let us see what a Bash Shell script is.

 03:02
The Bash Shell script  contains a series of Bash commands in plain text file.

 03:08
 It tells the Shell to execute this text file instead of typing the commands.

 03:15
 Let us see how to write a simple Bash script.

 03:20
 We will test the echo command which will print Hello World on the terminal.

 03:25
Go back to the terminal.

 03:29
Now, type: echo space within double quotes Hello  world

03:35
and press Enter.

03:37
 This prints Hello World on the terminal.

 03:40
 The command worked as expected.

 03:43
 Now, what if we want to use this command in a file?

 03:47
 Just put this command in a file and execute that file.

 03:52
 I will use gedit text-editor for this purpose.

 03:57
 You are free to use your favorite text-editor.

04:00
 I want to create my file on the Desktop.

 04:03
 So, type: cd space Desktop

 04:07
 Press Enter.

 04:09
Now, type: gedit space hello underscore world dot sh space &(ampersand sign).

04:20
gedit is the text editor. 'Hello underscore world dot sh' is the file name and

04:27
we use the & (ampersand) to free up the prompt.

 04:32
 Now press Enter.

04:33
 We have opened a new file named hello_world.sh using gedit.

 04:40
 Now, type: hash exclamation mark front slash bin front slash bash

 04:47
 This is the first line of every bash script.

 04:51
 It is called as shebang or bang line.

04:55
Press Enter.

 04:57
Now, let's add a comment to the file by typing:

05:00
hash space My first Bash script

 05:06
 Remember that any line after hash is treated as a comment.

05:11
And comments are ignored by the Bash interpreter.

 05:15
 Now we can add the command which we used earlier.

05:19
Press Enter

05:20
 and type: echo space within double quotes Hello world.

05:27
 Press Enter.

 05:28
Type: echo space dollar-sign SHELL (in Capital)

05:34
 press Enter.

05:35
 Type: echo space backtick date backtick

05:41
backtick symbol is present on the key which has tilde character.

05:47
Now, click on Save to save the file.

05:50
Let us execute. Come back to our terminal.

05:55
 First, we have to  make the file executable.

 05:58
 For this, type: chmod space plus x space hello underscore world dot sh

06:09
and press Enter.

06:12
 Now, type:

06:14
dot slash hello underscore world dot sh

06:19
Press Enter.

 06:22
 You can see Hello World is displayed on the terminal.

 06:27
 The shell type is displayed on the next line. i.e slash bin slash bash

 06:32
  and day, month, time, time zone and year are displayed.

06:38
The output may vary depending on the system.

 06:43
 Let us go back to our slides and summarize.

06:46
