  Dear friends, welcome to the spoken tutorial on String and File Attributes comparison in Bash.

 00:10
 In this tutorial, we will learn:

 00:13
 * String comparison and File attributes comparison.

 00:18
 We will do this using a few examples.

 00:22
  For this tutorial, I am using:

 00:25
 * Ubuntu Linux 12.04 Operating System and

 00:30
 * GNU BASH version 4.1.10

 00:34
 Please note, GNU Bash version 4 or above is recommended to practice this tutorial.

  00:42
   Let us start with an introduction.

  00:45
 There are two ways to compare a string in Bash.

  00:49
 1) First: using == (equal to equal to) operator

 00:53
 to compare two equal strings.

 00:56
 2) Second: != (not equal to) operator

 00:59
 to compare two not equal strings.

 01:03
 Let us look at an example.

  01:06
  I have a simple program here that checks the user ID.

 01:11
  Open a file in your editor and save it as strcompare dot sh.

  01:19
 Now type the code as shown here, in your strcompare dot sh file.

 01:26
  Let me explain the code.

 01:28
 This is shebang line.

 01:31
 whoami command gives the username of the current user.

  01:36
  The if statement checks the output of the variable whoami  against the string “root”.

  01:44
 We have used not-equal to operator here to compare the strings.

  01:50
  If the current user is not the root user, then it will echo this statement -

 01:57
 “You have no permission to run 'strcompare dot sh' as non-root user.”

 02:05
 Here, $0 (dollar zero) is the zeroth argument which is a 'file-name' itself.

  02:13
   If the user is the root user, it will echo - “Welcome root!”.

 02:18
  Then we have the exit statement for the program.

 02:23
 And here with "fi"  we end the if statement.

   02:28
  Let us switch back to our slides to know more about the exit statement.

 02:34
   Every program returns an exit status.

 02:38
 A successful command returns a 0 (zero).

 02:42
 An erroneous command returns a non-zero value.

 02:47
 It can be interpreted as an error code.

 02:51
 We can customize return value of the exit statement .

   02:56
   Now, let's execute the program.

   02:58
  Open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl+Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

   03:08
   First, let's check the current user of the system.

  03:12
 Type: whoami.

  03:15
 Press Enter.

  03:17
 This will output the name of the current user.

   03:21
  Now let's make our script executable.

 03:25
 Type: chmod +x strcompare dot sh

 03:32
 Type: dot slash strcompare dot sh

 03:37
  The output is displayed as:

 03:39
 You have no permission to run dot slash strcompare dot sh as non-root user.

 03:47
  Now let's execute the same program as root user.

 03:52
 Type: sudo dot slash strcompare dot sh 

  03:58
  It will prompt for a password.

  04:01
 Give your password here.

  04:04
   The output is displayed as: Welcome root!. 

 04:08
  Now, let's learn about the file attributes comparison.

  04:13
  I already have a working example of the code.

 04:17
  In this program, we will check whether a given file exists or not.

 04:23
 file1 is the variable in which we save the path of the file.

  04:29
 -(hyphen) f command checks whether the file exists or not

  04:33
 and whether it is a normal file.

  04:37
   If the condition is True,  it will echo "File exists and is a normal file" .

   04:44
   Else, it will echo "File does not exist" .

   04:48
 Switch back to the terminal. Let us execute our file.

   04:53
   Type: chmod  plus x fileattrib dot sh

  05:00
   Type: dot slash fileattrib dot sh

  05:05
  The output is displayed as:

  05:07
 "File exists and is a normal file".

  05:11
  Now we will check whether the file is empty or not.

 05:16
   Before executing our program, I will create an empty file named as empty dot sh.

 05:24
 Type: gedit empty dot sh ampersand sign.

 05:31
 Click on Save,  close the file.

 05:35
Let us replace  - (hyphen) f attribute with - (hyphen) s attribute.

  05:41
  Replace the filename here as well.

  05:45
 Type  empty dot sh .

   05:47
   Now, replace the first echo statement with:

  05:51
  “File exists and is not empty”

 05:54
 and the second echo statement with:

 05:57
  “File is empty”.

  05:59
 Click on Save.

 06:01
  Come back to the terminal.

 06:03
 Let me clear the prompt.

 06:06
 Let's execute.

 06:08
 Type: dot slash fileattrib dot sh press Enter.

 06:13
 The output is "File is empty".

  06:17
   Now, let us see another file attribute which will check the write permission of any file.

  06:24
  Come back to our program.

  06:26
 Let us replace the - (hyphen) s attribute with - (hyphen) w.

  06:32
   Now replace the first echo statement with:

  06:36
 “User has write permission to this file”.

  06:40
 And the second echo statement with:

  06:43
 “User doesn't have write permission to this file”.

  06:47
 Click on Save.

  06:49
  I will use a different file for this example.

  06:53
 I will select a file which is not a readable file or which does not have write permission.

   07:01
 Let me change the file path to

 07:04
 “slash etc slash mysql slash debian dot cnf”

 07:10
 Click on Save.

 07:12
 Let us execute our program.

 07:15
 Press the up-arrow key. Press Enter.

 07:19
  We see that the output is displayed as:

 07:21
 "User doesn't have write permission to this file".

 07:26
  Now, let us see another example based on file attributes.

 07:31
 In this example, we will check whether 'file1' is newer than 'file2'.

  07:38
   Let us see the program.

  07:40
 Note that our file-name is fileattrib2 dot sh.

  07:46
 Let's go through the code.

  07:48
  Here we have two variables file1 and file2.

  07:53
 The two files have already been created and are empty.

  07:58
  Here, we check whether file1  is newer than file2.

 08:04
  If the condition is True, we print "file1 is newer than  file2".

 08:09
 Else, "file2 is newer than  file1".

 08:14
 This is another if statement.

   08:16
  Here we check whether file1 is older than file2.

 08:21
 If the condition is True, we print "file1 is older than  file2".

 08:27
 Else, we print "file2 is older than  file1".

   08:32
  Come back to our terminal.

   08:35
 First, we will edit empty1 dot sh file.

 08:39
  I will just add an echo statement in it.

 08:42
 Type: echo within double quotes hiii after the double quotes greater than sign empty one dot sh. Press Enter.

  08:53
  Now, let us make our script executable.

 08:57
 Type: chmod plus x fileattrib2 dot sh.

  09:03
  Now, type: dot slash fileattrib2 dot sh.

   09:09
  We see the output as:

  09:11
 file1 is newer than file2

  09:15
 file2 is older than file1.

  09:19
   Now let's edit empty2 dot sh file.

 09:23
 Here also I will add an echo statement.

  09:27
   Type: echo within double quotes How are you after the quotes greater than sign (>)empty2 dot sh.

  09:38
 Let me clear the prompt.

 09:41
  Now let us execute our script again.

 09:45
 Press the up-arrow key.

 09:47
 Go to dot slash fileattrib2 dot sh Press Enter.

  09:53
  Now the output is displayed as:

  09:55
 "file2 is newer than file1"

  09:59
 And "file1 is older than file2".

  10:03
  This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
