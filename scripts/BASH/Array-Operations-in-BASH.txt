 Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Array operations in BASH.

 00:05
 In this tutorial, we will learn how to:
 Declare an  array and assign values to it.


 00:12
* Initialize an array during declaration.

 00:15
* To find length of an  array and its nth element.

 00:20
* To print an array.

  00:22
 To follow this tutorial, You should be familiar with  Linux Operating System.

  00:27
 For relevant tutorials, please visit: spoken hyphen tutorial dot org.

 00:33
For this tutorial, I am using:

 00:37
 * Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS

 00:41
 * GNU Bash version 4.1.10

 00:45
 GNU Bash version 4 or above is recommended for practice.

 00:50
Let us start with the definition of an  array and its characteristics.

 00:55
 * An array is a variable with multiple values.

 01:01
 * The values can be of same or different types.

 01:04
 * There is no maximum limit for the size of an array.

 01:08
 * Array members need not be consecutive.

 01:12
 * Array index always starts with zero.

  01:16
 We will now see how to declare and assign a value to an array.

  01:21
 The syntax to declare an array is-

  01:24
 declare hyphen 'a' arrayname

 01:28
 “declare” keyword is used to declare an array.

 01:31
 It is a built-in command in Bash.

 01:35
 The syntax to assign a value to an array is-

 01:38
 Name within square brackets index equals to within single quotes value.

  01:46
 Now, let see how to initialize an array during declaration.

  01:51
 * Array can be declared and initialized at the same time.

 01:56
* Elements Should be separated by a space .

 02:00
 Each element should be within parentheses.

 02:03
 The syntax is declare hyphen 'a' arrayname equal to within round brackets within single quotes 'element1' , 'element2' and element3 .

  02:19
 Let us try an example.

  02:21
 Open the terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt and T keys simultaneously.

 02:28
 Now Type: gedit space array.sh space ampersand (&)

 02:36
 We use the ampersand to free up the prompt. Press Enter.

 02:41
 Type the code as shown here, in your "array.sh" file.

 02:47
 This line declares an array named Linux with elements -
"Debian", "Redhat", "Ubuntu" and "Fedora".

 02:57
 Here hyphen a is a flag.

 03:00
 It allows us to read and assign values to an array.

 03:05
 Let us switch back to our slides.

  03:07
 The length of an array can be obtained by this syntax:

  03:12
 Dollar sign ($) opening curly bracket hash arrayname within square brackets "At" sign (@) and closing curly bracket.

 03:22
 The length of the nth element can be obtained by this syntax:

 03:28
 Dollar sign opening curly bracket hash arrayname within square brackets  'n' and closing curly bracket.

 03:37
 Here 'n' is the element number whose length is to be found.

 03:42
 All the elements of the array can be printed using this syntax.

 03:48
 Dollar sign opening curly bracket arrayname within square brackets 'At' sign (@) and closing curly bracket.

 03:57
 Now come back to our text editor.

 04:00
 This line will display total number of elements in the array Linux.

 04:06
 hyphen 'e' enables interpretation of backslash escapes.

 04:11
 We have included this as we have backslash 'n'  at the end of the line.

 04:18
 The next line displays all the elements of the array Linux.

 04:23
 This line displays the 3rd element of the array Linux.

 04:28
 Please note that an array always starts with index zero.

 04:34
Lastly, this line displays the number of characters present in the 3rd element.

 04:40
 Now, switch to the Terminal.

 04:42
 Let's first make the file executable by typing chmod space plus x space array.sh. Press Enter.

 04:56
 Type: dot slash array .sh. Press Enter.

 05:01
 The output is displayed.

 05:04
The number of elements or the length of the array 'Linux'  is four.

 05:10
 The elements of the array Linux are Debian, Redhat, Ubuntu and Fedora.

 05:18
 The third element of  array Linux is  Ubuntu.

 05:22
 And the number of characters in the third element is six, as expected.

 05:29
 This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

 05:32
 Let us summarize. Come back to our slides.

 05:35
 In this tutorial, we learned to:

 05:40
 * Declare and assign values to an array

 05:43
* Initialize an array during declaration

 05:46
* To find length of an array and its nth element and

 05:51
 * To print whole array.

 05:53
As an assignment-

 05:55
 Declare an array names of length 7 and find:

 06:00
 * the total number of elements

 06:02
* print all the elements

 06:04
* and print the 5th element.
