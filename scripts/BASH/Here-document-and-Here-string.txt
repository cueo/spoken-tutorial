  Dear friends, welcome to the spoken tutorial on HERE document and strings.

  00:08
  In this tutorial, we will learn about

  00:11
  special-purpose redirection called Here documents and Here strings

  00:17
  with the help of some examples.

 00:20
  To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of Shell Scripting in BASH.

  00:26
If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown. http://www.spoken-tutorial.org

 00:32
  For this tutorial, I am using:

  00:34
* Ubuntu Linux 12.04 Operating System

  00:39
* GNU BASH version 4.2

  00:42
Please note, GNU Bash version 4 or above is recommended for practice.

 00:49
  Let us learn about 'Here' document.

  00:52
* It is a special purpose block of text or code.

  00:56
* It is a form of I/O redirect.

  01:00
* It feeds a command list to an interactive program or command line.

  01:06
* It can be treated as a separate file.

  01:10
* It can also be treated as multiple line input redirected to a shell script.

 01:17
  Syntax is-

  01:18
command space less than less than space HERE.

  01:24
After this, on the next line, we can give the text inputs.

  01:29
It can consist of any number of lines.

  01:33
Here, text1, text2, textN are the text inputs.

  01:40
After the text inputs, on the next line, we type the keyword HERE again.

  01:46
It denotes the closing of HERE document.

  01:50
  Let us understand this with an example.

  01:53
I will open a file named here dot sh .

 01:59
  The first line of code is the shebang line.

  02:04
  Let me put a block of code after this line.

 02:09
 'wc' represents word count.

 02:12
 wc hyphen w counts the number of words in the HERE document.

 02:20
The block of code or text until the second occurrence of HERE will be treated as a file.

 02:28
The content present in HERE document is an input to the command wc hyphen w.

 02:36
 HERE acts as a delimiter for wc hyphen w command while reading multi-line input.

  02:47
If we try to execute the same command in the terminal, we should get '4' as an output.

  02:55
This is because we have passed four words to the command wc hyphen w.

  03:03
Now click on Save to save the file.

 03:06
  Let us switch to the Terminal using Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

03:15
 Type: chmod space plus x space here dot sh

  03:22
Press Enter.

  03:24
Type: dot slash here dot sh

  03:27
Press Enter.

 03:30
  We can see the output as 4

  03:33
that is, number of words in 'Here' document is 4.

 03:38
  Come back to our program.

  03:41
Let us add two more words here, at the beginning of the text.

 03:47
Hello and welcome to Bash learning.

 03:52
  Click on Save.

  03:54
Let us execute the program again.

 03:57
  On the terminal, type: dot slash here dot sh

  04:04
Press Enter.

  04:06
  Now the output is 6 because we added two more words to our text.

  04:13
  We can also pass an argument to the Here document.

 04:18
  Let us see how to do this with an example.

  04:22
Let me open a file named hereoutput dot sh.

 04:28
  The command cat will concatenate files and print the standard output.

 04:35
  Note that we have used the string "this"  instead of "HERE".

  04:41
Itâ€™s not necessary that you always have to use the delimiter HERE.

  04:47
You can use any other delimiter also.

 04:51
  This line will display the 0th (zeroth) argument.

  04:55
The 0th (zeroth) argument, by default, is the filename.

  05:00
  This line will display the 1st argument passed to the program.

  05:05
  And this line will display the 2nd argument passed to the program.

  05:09
  Here we have to close the document using the same delimiter this.

  05:17
 Save the file.

  05:18
  Let us now execute the program.

  05:21
On the terminal, type: chmod space plus x space hereoutput dot sh.

 05:29
Press Enter

  05:32
Type: dot slash hereoutput dot sh space Sunday space Monday

  05:40
  The output is displayed as:

  05:43
"0'th argument is: dot salsh hereoutput dot sh"  which is the filename.

  05:49
"1st argument is: Sunday"

  05:51
"2nd argument is: Monday" .

 05:55
  Let us learn about "Here" string now.

  05:59
* Here string is used for input redirection from text or a variable.

  06:06
* The input is mentioned in the same line within single quotes.

 06:12
  The syntax is- command space three 'less than symbols' space within single quotes write string

  06:22
  Let us understand this with an example.

  06:25
I will open the same file here dot sh.

 06:30
  Here at the end, I will type: wc space hyphen w three less than symbols space within single quotes Welcome to Bash learning.

  06:44
This will redirect the string within quotes to the command wc hyphen w.

  06:52
Now click on Save to save the changes.

 06:55
  We will switch to the Terminal.

 06:58
  Now type: dot slash here dot sh.

  07:03
  We can see the output as 6 and 4.

  07:08
Number of words in here document is 6 and number of words in here string is 4.

  07:15
  Likewise, you can write your own Here strings.

  07:20
  This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

 07:23
Let us summarize.

  07:25
In this tutorial, we learnt about:

  07:27
* HERE document

  07:29
* HERE string.

 07:31
  As an assignment, convert a string to uppercase using:

  07:36
* Here document

  07:37
* Here string.

  07:39
Hint: tr space  a hyphen z space capital A hyphen capital Z.

  07:47
This is the command to convert characters from lower to upper case.
