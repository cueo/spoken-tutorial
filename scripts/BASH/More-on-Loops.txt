 Welcome to the spoken tutorial on  Nested for loop in BASH.

 00:07
 In this tutorial, we will learn  Nested for loop with the help of an example.

 00:13
 To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux 12.04 Operating System and GNU BASH version 4.1.10

 00:24
Please note, GNU Bash version 4 or above is recommended for practice.

00:31
 To learn this tutorial, you should be familiar with loops in Bash.

 00:37

 00:43
 Let us start with an introduction to nested loop.

00:46
A loop within a loop is known as nested loop.

 00:51
 Let us see the syntax. Outer for loop expression 1, 2, 3;

 00:57
inner for loop expression 1, 2, 3;

 01:01
 statement 1, statement 2

 01:04
 closing inner for loop, closing outer for loop.

 01:09
 Let us see an example on nested for loop.

 01:12
 First, let us go through the directory structure.

01:17
Here is a directory on the Desktop named simple-nested-for. Let's open it.

 01:24
 We have sub-directories "test", "test2", "test3" and a Bash script.

01:31
In each sub-directory, there are multiple text files.

01:36
 Now we will move on to our code.

01:39
This program displays all the files within each sub-directory.

01:45
Please note that the same can be achieved with a single line command ls -1 (hyphen one) -R(hyphen R) test*(test asterisk).

01:53
But we will do it using a for loop.

 01:58
 Note that the name of our Bash script is nested-(hyphen)for dot sh.

02:05
 This is our shebang line.

02:08
 This is the outer for loop.

02:10
This for loop will check for directories starting with the name test.

02:15
First echo line will display the sub-directories name.

02:21
The second echo line will create a blank line.

 02:25
 This is the inner for loop. It will check for the files present within the directories.

02:32
"ls" displays the directory content.

02:36
-1 (hyphen one) is used to list one file per line.

 02:41
 Here, we list the files. done ends the inner for loop.

02:45
This command prints a horizontal line after completion of every cycle of outer for-loop.

02:53
done ends the outer for loop.

 02:57
 Let us execute the program.

02:58
Open the terminal by pressing ctrl+alt+t keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

03:08
Now, let us go to the directory where our Bash script is.

03:13
It is on the Desktop.

03:15
Type: cd Desktop. Let us go in the folder simple-(Hyphen)nested-(Hyphen)for

03:22
Press Enter.

 03:24
 Type: chmod plus +x nested-(Hyphen)for dot sh

03:32
Press Enter.

03:34
Type: dot slash nested-(Hyphen)for dot sh

03:39
Press Enter.

03:40
The output is displayed. It shows  files in test directory, files in test2 directory and files in test3 directory.

03:52
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

03:56
Let us summarize. In this tutorial, we learned Nested for loop.

 04:02
 As an assignment:

04:04
* Retype: nested (hyphen)-for dot sh bash script using nested while loop.

04:11
* Save your program with the name 'nested-(hyphen)while dot sh'.
