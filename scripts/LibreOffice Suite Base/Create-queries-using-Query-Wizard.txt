Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

00:06
In this tutorial, we will learn how to:
 create simple queries using the Query wizard
 Select fields 
 Set the sorting order of the fields and
 provide search criteria or conditions for a query.


00:24
Let us first learn what a query is.

00:29
A query can be used to get specific information from a database.

00:36
In other words, we can "query" the database for some data that matches a given criteria.

00:48
For example, let us consider our familiar 'Library' database example.

00:56
We have stored information about books and members in our Library database.

01:04
Now we can query the Library database for all the members of the Library.

01:12
Or we can query the database for all the books that are not in the Library.

01:21
Let us see how we can create a simple query using Base.

01:30
Our example is to list all the members of the 'Library' along with their phone numbers.

01:44
We are in the 'Library' database. You probably know how to open this by now.

01:51
Let us click on the Queries icon on the left panel.

01:57
On the right panel, we see three options.

02:03
Since we are creating a simple query first, we will choose an easy and fast method.

02:11
And that is by using a Query Wizard.

02:17
For creating complex queries, Base provides us with very handy options such as 'Create Query in Design View'

02:28
and 'Create Query in SQL view' which we will learn about later.

02:36
For now, let us click on 'Use Wizard to Create Query'.

02:43
Now, we see a pop-up window that says Query Wizard on the top.

02:50
On the left, we see 8 steps that we will go through.

02:57
We are in Step 1 - 'Field Selection'.

03:03
On the right side, we will see a drop-down box underneath the label Tables.

03:11
This is where we will select the source of the data that we need from this query.

03:21
Since our example query is about getting a list of all the members of the Library, we will click on the Tables: Members from the drop-down box.

03:35
Now, let us double-click on the Name field in the Available fields list on the left and move it to the list box on the right.

03:50
Next, let us click on the Phone field on the left and move it to the right.

04:00
Note that to move all the fields to the right, we can use the double-arrow button that points to the right.

04:09
Now, let us click on the Next button at the bottom.

04:15
Now we are in Step 2 - Sorting Order.

04:20
Since the result of our query is a list of members and their phone numbers, we can leave this as it is.

04:30
Or we can order the list by member names.

04:36
The Base Wizard allows us to sort up to 4 fields in the result list at a time.

04:45
For now, let us click on the top most drop-down box,

04:51
And click on Members.Name.

04:55
We can also choose if we want to sort the names in ascending or descending order.

05:03
Let us click on the Ascending option

05:07
and proceed to the next step.

05:11
Step 3 - Search Conditions.

05:16
This step will help if we want to limit our result set to some conditions.

05:22
For example, we can limit the result set to only those members whose name starts with the alphabet R.

05:34
For this, we will click on the Fields drop-down box and then click on Members.Name.

05:45
Now, click on the Condition drop-down box.

05:51
Notice the various conditions here.

05:58
Let us click on like.

06:02
In the Value text box, let us type in ‘capital R’ and a ‘percentage symbol’.

06:13
This is how we can introduce simple and complex conditions into our query.

06:22
Let us now delete the 'R%' from the Value text-box to list all the members and click on the Next button.

06:37
Please note that we have skipped to Step 7.

06:43
This is because we are creating a simple query from a single table.

06:51
And our query will return details and not summaries.

06:57
Summary queries show data from aggregate functions and by grouping.

07:05
Some examples are count of all the members or sum of the prices of all the books.

07:13
We will learn about these later.

07:17
Okay, now here let us set aliases,

07:23
meaning- let us provide friendly and descriptive labels or headers in the resulting list.

07:32
So the 'Name' field can have an alias as 'Member Name' and the 'Phone' field can have an alias as 'Phone Number'.

07:46
So, let us type in these new aliases in the two text-boxes and click on the Next button.

07:57
Now, we are in Step 8 - the final step.

08:03
Here let us give a nice descriptive name to our simple query.

08:09
Let us type in 'List of all members and their phone numbers' against the 'Name of the Query’ label.

08:20
Now, notice that we see an overview of our choices in the wizard.

08:27
And how do we want to proceed from here?

08:31
Let us click on the 'Display Query' option on the top right side and click on the Finish button.

08:41
The wizard window has closed and there is a new window whose title says- 'List of all members and their phone numbers'.

08:52
Notice that we see all the four members that we originally entered in the Members table along with their phone numbers.

09:04
Also, we see that this list is arranged alphabetically in ascending order.

09:13
So, this is our first simple query.

09:18
Here is an assignment.

09:21
Create a query that will list all the Books in ascending order.

09:28
Include all fields.

09:31
Name it as ‘List of all books in the Library’.

09:38
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Creating Queries using Wizard in LibreOffice Base.

09:45
To summarize, we learned how to :
 Create simple queries using the Query wizard 
 Select fields 
 Set the sorting order of the fields And 
 provide search criteria or conditions for a query.
