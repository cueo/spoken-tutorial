Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

00:04
In this tutorial on Modifying a Form, we will learn how to enter data in a form, modify a form.

00:14
In the previous tutorial, we learnt to create a form using LibreOffice Base.

00:22
We created a simple Books data entry form in our example 'Library' database.

00:29
Let us see how we can enter data into the Books table, using this form.

00:39
Let us first invoke the LibreOffice Base program, if it's not already open.

00:48
And open our 'Library' database.

00:52
If Base is already open then we can open the Library database from here by clicking the Open inside the File menu

01:03
or by clicking the Recent Documents inside the File menu.

01:08
Now we are in the 'Library' Database.

01:12
Let us click on the Forms icon in the Database list on the left panel.

01:18
Notice that the 'Books Data entry form', under Forms, is highlighted in the centre of this window.

01:28
Let us right-click on this form name and click on Open.

01:33
Now, we see a new window with a blue background, with labels and text boxes corresponding to the fields in the Books table.

01:45
Let us click on the Tab key to go to each field and as we go to the last, Base opens the next record.

01:56
This way we can traverse the records.

02:00
Or we can also use the black triangle icons in the bottom toolbar to navigate among the records.

02:10
Alternately, to simply go to a particular record, type in the record number in the bottom toolbar and press Enter key or the Tab key.

02:23
Let us go to the last record which is the fifth.

02:29
Now, let us add a new record.

02:34
To do this, click on the New Record icon, that is second right of the Last record icon in the bottom toolbar.

02:46
Notice that we see empty text boxes and the record number at the bottom says 6.

02:55
Now we are ready to add a new record with information about a new book.

03:03
Let us type in 'Paradise Lost' in the Title text box and let us use Tab key to navigate to the next field.

03:17
Let us type in 'John Milton' against Author,

03:23
'1975' against PublishedYear,

03:28
'Oxford' against Publisher

03:31
and 200 against Price.

03:36
There, we have just entered a new record into the Books table by using the Books Data Entry Form.

03:45
We will close this window.

03:47
We can add more records or data in this way.

03:53
Let us see if Base has updated the Books table with the last record we entered just now.

04:02
For this, in the LibreOffice Base main window, let us double-click on Books table on the right panel.

04:12
Notice the new record that we entered through the form here.

04:18
Okay, we will close this window now.

04:23
Next, let us learn how to make simple modifications to our form.

04:30
We will click on the Forms icon in the Database list on the left panel.

04:37
And open the 'Books Data Entry form' for modifying by right-clicking on it and then choosing 'Edit'.

04:47
A familiar window opens now

04:51
except that if you click on the label title, you will see several small green boxes enclosing the label and the text box.

05:03
This means that we are in the form design window.

05:08
And we can modify the look and feel of the form and its elements as well as its functionalities.

05:17
For example, we can change the placement and size of the labels and text-boxes.

05:25
These are also called properties.

05:28
Double-click on the label Title.

05:31
This opens a smaller pop-up window called Properties.

05:38
Notice the various elements here.

05:48
Now, let us click on the label author, notice that the Properties window refreshes and shows the properties of label Author.

06:01
So, as we click on various elements on the form, we see that the 'Properties window' refreshes to show the selected element's properties.

06:14
Now, the 'Properties window' title reads as Properties Multiselection.

06:21
This is because we see that the Author label and its textbox adjacent to it, are encased in one set of green boxes.

06:34
Base automatically has grouped the labels and corresponding textboxes in the form. We can un-group them.

06:44
Right-click on the Title label and then click on Group at the bottom, then click on Ungroup.

06:54
Now we see that the label Title and its text-box have been ungrouped.

07:02
In this way, we can modify the properties of individual elements on the form.

07:10
Next, let us add a tool tip to the Title text-box.

07:16
Now, let us scroll to the bottom in the Properties window.

07:22
Notice the label 'Help text' and here, let us type in 'Enter the title of the book here'.

07:32
Now, let us save the form by clicking on the Save icon, below the File menu, on the top. And we will close this window.

07:46
Let us now see, how our form looks like after the modification that we made.

07:54
For this, let us go to the Base main window, click on the Forms icon on the left panel

08:03
and double-click on 'Books Data Entry Form' on the right panel.

08:10
Let us point the mouse over the Title label or the text-box.

08:17
Notice that a tool-tip appears saying 'Enter the title of the book here'.

08:24
So now, we have learnt how to make a simple modification to our form.

08:31
We will see how to make more modifications to a form, in the next part of the Base tutorial.

08:39
Here is an assignment.

08:41
Create a simple form for the Members table.

08:46
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Modifying a Form in LibreOffice Base.

08:52
To summarize, we learned: how to enter data in a form, how to Modify a form.
