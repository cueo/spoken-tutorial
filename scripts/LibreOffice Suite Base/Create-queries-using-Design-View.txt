Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

00:04
In this tutorial, we will learn how to:

00:06
* Create a query by using the Design View.

00:10
* Add tables to the Query Design window

00:13
* Select fields
 Set up aliases
 Set up sorting order and
 provide search criteria for a query.


00:23
For this, let us consider our familiar 'Library' database example.

00:29
In this 'Library' database, we have stored information about books and members.

00:37
And, we also have a table to track the books issued to the members.

00:45
Now we will create a new query to list all the books that have been issued to the members.

00:54
In other words, let us generate a history of books that have been issued to the members.

01:03
Let's open the Library database.

01:07
Let us click on the Queries icon on the left panel.

01:13
On the right panel, we will click on the ‘Create Query in Design view’. We now see a new window which is also called the Query Design window.

01:28
And we also see a small pop-up window at the top that says Add Table or Query.

01:39
Here is where we will define the source of the data for the query.

01:46
And we will need all the three tables for our query to generate the history of the books issued to members.

01:57
We will do this by clicking on the Books table in the list and then clicking on the Add button on the right in the pop-up window.

02:11
We will similarly add the BooksIssued table and the Members table. <pause>

02:19
We now see that the three tables have appeared in the background query design window.

02:26
Let us now close the pop-up window.

02:31
This brings the Query design window to the foreground.

02:39
Notice that the three tables are in the top half of the window.

02:46
Here, let us introduce some space among these tables.

02:53
Let us click, drag and drop the Members table to the far right.

03:01
And then click, drag and drop the BooksIssued table to the centre.

03:11
Now we see lines linking these tables and these are the relationships that we had established earlier.

03:23
We can double-click on the lines to see the relationship details.

03:30
For now, let us see the bottom half of the 'Query design' window.

03:37
This area has several rows of cells. As we design the query, we will fill these up.

03:48
First, we will check the Field column.

03:53
This is for specifying the fields we need to display in the result set.

04:01
To do this, we will first double-click on the Title field in the Books table in the upper half of the window.

04:12
Next is the Name field in the Members table.

04:17
And then, the Issue Date field in the BooksIssued table.

04:24
Next, the Return date,the actual return date. And finally the checked in field.

04:34
Notice these fields in the bottom half of the window in the first row.

04:44
Also the corresponding table names in the third row.

04:50
Next, let us look at the Alias in the second row.

04:57
This is where we can enter descriptive names for the selected fields.

05:04
So, let us type in aliases as shown in the image. <pause>

05:11
And we are done with the aliases.

05:15
Next, let us look at the Sort row.

05:21
We can specify the ordering of the result set here.

05:26
Since we need a history of the books issued, we will order it chronologically.

05:34
Meaning- we will sort the result set by the Issue Date in ascending order.

05:43
For this, we will click on the empty cell in the Sort row, under the Issuedate field. And let us click on Ascending.

05:56
Okay, we will go to the next row - ‘Visible’.

06:02
Here, we can set the visibility of the fields we selected by checking or un-checking them.

06:11
Notice that, by default, all of them are checked.

06:17
Next, we will go to the ‘Function’ row. This is used to create complex queries. We will skip this for now

06:27
and we will go to the ‘Criterion’ row.

06:32
This is where we can limit the result set to a simple or complex set of criteria.

06:40
For example, we can query for those books only which were issued but have not been returned by members.

06:49
Meaning- only those that are not checked-in.

06:54
So, let us click on the empty cell in this row, under the CheckedIn field and type in ‘Equals Zero’.

07:06
That's it. Let us run this query now.

07:10
We can use the keyboard shortcut F5 or click on the Edit menu at the top of the window
and then click on Run Query at the bottom.

07:27
Can you see some data in the upper half of the window?

07:32
These are the results of your query.

07:36
Notice that, we see a history of books issued to members and ordered by Issue Date. Also notice that none of the books are checked-in.

07:51
Now we can go to the query design area below and change it any way we want .

08:00
For example, let us remove the Checked In criterion. <pause>

08:07
Now, let us run the query by pressing F5 again.

08:15
This time we see a longer list of data returned from the query.

08:23
Next, let us save this query by pressing Control, S. This opens a small pop-up window.

08:34
Let us give a descriptive name to our query here.

08:38
Let us type ‘History of Books Issued to Members’

08:46
and then click on OK button. and close this window.

08:52
We can open this saved query by double-clicking on the query name in the main Base window.

09:01
So, there we have successfully created a query using the Design View.

09:09
Here is an assignment:

09:12
Generate a list of the books issued to the member Nisha Sharma. The list should be chronological by Issue date.

09:24
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Creating queries in Design View, in LibreOffice Base.

09:31
To summarize, we learned how to:

09:33
* Create a query by using the Design View
 Add tables to the Query Design window
 Select fields


09:41
* Set up aliases,
 Set up sorting order And
 provide search criteria for a query.
