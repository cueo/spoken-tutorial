Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

00:04
In this tutorial on Complex Forms, we will learn about:

00:08
* Building a complex form
 And modifying the form.


00:13
In the previous tutorial, we learnt how to enter data using forms and how to modify a form using LibreOffice Base.

00:22
In this tutorial, let us learn about building a complex form.

00:28
Let us first invoke the LibreOffice Base program, if it's not already open

00:44
and open our Library database.

00:47
If Base is already open, then we can open the "Library" database from here by clicking Open under File menu

00:57
or by clicking Recent Documents under File menu.

01:03
Let us design a new form that will help us track the books, issued to the Library members.

01:12
Let us see how we can design this form as shown in the screen image.

01:18
Let us go to the LibreOffice Base main window and click on the Forms icon in the Database list on the left panel

01:29
and then click on 'Use Wizard to create form'.

01:34
This opens the Forms window and the now familiar wizard on top.

01:41
We have already gone through this wizard in detail, so we will proceed quickly with it now.

01:49
In Step 1. Field Selection, let us choose 'Tables:BooksIssued' from the drop-down box, beneath the label that says 'Tables or queries'.

02:02
Let us move all the fields from the left to the right by using the double-arrow button. <pause>

02:10
Let's click on Next.

02:12
This is Step 2, but we will skip this step for now and click on the Next button at the bottom.

02:20
We are in step 5 now. Let us choose the first arrangement 'Columnar – Labels Left' and click on the Next button.

02:30
Let us skip 'Step 6' also by clicking on the Next button.

02:36
'Step 7.' Let us choose Ice blue and click on the Next button.

02:42
In 'Step 8', let's name the form as 'Books Issued to Members'  <pause>

02:53
and click on the 'Modify the form' option.

02:57
Next, click on the Finish button.

03:00
Notice that the wizard pop-up window is gone and we are looking at the Form Design window.

03:07
Here, we are going to make some modifications before we use the form for data entry.

03:15
Let us first Ungroup all the elements we see on the form.

03:22
We are doing this so that we can edit the properties of individual elements on the form easily.

03:31
To ungroup all the form elements in one shot, we need to first select all the form elements.

03:40
To do this, let us first open up the Form Design toolbar

03:46
by clicking on the View menu at the top, then click on Toolbars and then click on Form Design.

03:56
In this toolbar, let us click once on the mouse pointer icon which is the first and the leftmost icon.

04:05
We will call this as the Select icon from now on.

04:11
This is used for selecting form elements by clicking and dragging.

04:18
Now, let us click on the top left of the form and drag it diagonally to the bottom right.

04:26
You will now see a rectangle with alternating black and white lines.

04:32
Let’s make sure, all the form elements are inside this rectangle.

04:38
We will use this way repeatedly to select groups of form elements.

04:46
Now we see that all these elements are encased in small green boxes.

04:53
Now, whatever action we do here, will affect all the elements inside this area uniformly.

05:02
Now, let us move the mouse pointer on any label here.

05:08
Notice that the mouse pointer looks like a plus sign over labels and text-boxes.

05:18
So, let us right-click over a label and click on Group at the bottom and click on 'Ungroup'.

05:28
Let us now type a heading that will sit above all the form elements.

05:35
For this, let us push down the form elements and then centre them within the form.

05:43
So, first let us press the down-arrow key about seven times.

05:50
Then press the right-arrow key about 14 times.

05:57
Notice that this moves all the selected form elements towards the right and the centre of the form.

06:07
Now, let us bring the cursor to where we need to type the heading.

06:14
To do this, let us click on the top left of the form window area

06:21
and press the Enter key twice.

06:26
Then press the Tab key four times and then type 'Form to track Books Issued to Members'.

06:38
Now, as we click on the individual labels and text-boxes, we see that these elements are selected or highlighted individually.

06:52
Okay, next, let us rename the BookId and MemberId labels on the form.

07:00
We can do this by double-clicking on BookId label which opens up the now familiar Properties window.

07:12
Against label, type in "Book Title".

07:18
Now, let us click on the MemberId label on the form.

07:25
Notice that the 'Properties window' has refreshed and again here, we will type in 'Member Name' against 'Label'.

07:34
As we press the Tab key, we will notice the new label changes on the form.

07:43
Next, let us change the font sizes of these elements now.

07:49
Again, let us select all the elements.

07:54
We will use the click, drag and drop method.

07:59
And now, we will double-click on any label which in turn will open the 'Properties' window.

08:08
Let us scroll-down to find Font and click on the square button on its right.

08:18
In the new pop-up window, let us click on Bold and click on size 8,

08:26
and let us click on the OK button.

08:29
Notice that the font has changed to Bold and size 8 across the form now.

08:38
Next, let us move all the form elements to the centre of the window.

08:45
For this, we will select all the elements.

08:49
Now let us click and drag on any label, toward the centre of the Form Design window.

09:00
Now let us save the form

09:03
and close this window. To see how our form looks like now,

09:10
let us go to the Base main window and double-click on the 'Books Issued to Members' form on the right panel.

09:20
This opens the form which is ready for data entry use.

09:26
Now, in this form, we see some sample data.

09:31
And against Book Title and Member Name, we see some numbers

09:37
which are really primary numbers in the Books and Members table, but not very friendly values.

09:46
Would you like to see real names and book titles?

09:50
And, how do we do this?

09:53
One way is to add a form control called List box.

09:59
We will see how to add and use a list box and other form controls in the next tutorial.

10:08
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Complex Forms in LibreOffice Base.

10:13
To summarize, we learned about:
 Building a complex form and
 Modifying the form.
