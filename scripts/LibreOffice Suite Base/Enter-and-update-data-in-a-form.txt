Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

00:06
In this tutorial, we will learn how to

00:09
 enter and update data in a form.

00:12
In the last tutorial, we learnt how to add form controls to a form.

00:19
In this tutorial, let us learn how to enter data and update data using a form.

00:27
Before doing this, let us make just three more modifications to our form design.

00:36
Let us first invoke the LibreOffice Base program, if it's not already open

00:51
and open our 'Library database'

00:54
by clicking Open under File menu.

00:58
Now we are in the Library database.

01:02
And, we will open the 'Books Issued to Members' form.

01:07
To do this, let us click on the Forms icon on the left panel and then right-click on the 'Books Issued to Members' form on the right panel

01:20
and then click on Edit.

01:24
We are now in the Form Design window.

01:28
Here, let us first resize the form, so it looks compact and less imposing.

01:36
To do this, we will decrease the height and length of our form window.

01:43
We will do this by clicking, dragging and dropping on the top and sides of the form window.

01:51
Next, let us change the font of the heading on our form.

01:57
Let us change the font to Arial Black and Size 12 from the Formatting toolbar at the top.

02:12
Finally, let us look at the Tab Order of the form controls.

02:19
This helps us to use keyboard tab keys to navigate across the form controls in a particular order.

02:29
Say, for example, from the top to the bottom.

02:33
This is called the tab order.

02:37
Now, Base automatically sets the tab order of the form controls from top to bottom in a form.

02:47
But since we removed a couple of text boxes and added two new list boxes and four buttons, we may have mixed up the tab order.

03:00
So, we will set it right now.

03:05
In the Form Design toolbar, usually found at the bottom of the window, we will browse through the icons

03:16
and find the icon with the tool tip that says 'Activation order'.

03:25
Let us click on this icon.

03:29
Now, we see a small pop-up window with 'Tab Order' as its title.

03:38
To order these form controls, we can either click, drag and drop the items.

03:46
Or we can use the 'Move up' or 'Move down' buttons.

03:52
So, let us set the tab order as shown in the image here. <pause>

04:04
We are done. So, let us click on the OK button to save these changes.

04:12
Okay, now let us save our form by pressing Control S

04:19
and then we will close the form window.

04:24
And finally, we are done with our Form design.

04:29
Now, let us test our form.

04:33
In the main Base window, let us open the 'Books Issued to Members' form by double-clicking on it.

04:42
Now, the form is open in data entry mode.

04:47
Notice the heading that says 'Form to track Books issued to Members'.

04:54
And here, we see book titles and member names instead of 'bookIds' and 'memberIds'.

05:03
Also, this is the first record of the BooksIssued table; we see that 'An Autobiography' is highlighted against the Book title.

05:15
And 'Nisha Sharma' highlighted against the Member name.

05:21
And we also see the rest of the fields.

05:25
Now we can traverse through all the records by using the Form Navigation toolbar icons at the bottom.

05:45
Let us go to the second record now.

05:49
Here we see that the member Jacob Robin has borrowed the book 'Macbeth' and let us assume now that he is returning the book.

06:01
So, let us update this information into this record.

06:07
For this, we will type in the actual return date, for example- 7/7/11

06:17
and check the Checked In field.

06:21
To save this information, we will press the Save Record button that we put there.

06:30
Notice that the button is greyed out, meaning now it is disabled from use.

06:38
But if we edit this record again then the button gets enabled again.

06:45
Okay, now let us test the Undo changes button.

06:50
For this, let us edit the record by clicking on the book title 'Conquest of Self' and then typing in 5/7/11 in the Actual Return Date field.

07:06
Notice that both the Save record button and the Undo changes button are enabled for use.

07:15
Now, let us click on the Undo Changes button and see what happens.

07:22
The changes we did last, have been undone.  Notice that 'Macbeth' is highlighted instead of 'Conquest of Self' and the Actual return date is 7/7/11.

07:37
Good, let us now click on the Delete Record button, meaning- we are trying to delete this second record.

07:47
Base is cautious about deletes, so it asks for a confirmation by alerting us.

07:55
For now, let us go ahead and click on the Yes button.

08:02
We can see that the record is indeed deleted; gone from the screen and in its place we see the next record.

08:13
Finally, let us add a new record by clicking on the last button on the form which is New record.

08:22
Let us type some values.

08:26
Since the IssueId is an auto generating field, we will skip it.

08:33
And here, let us add data as shown in the image.

08:42
To save the entries, click on the Save Record button.

08:47
There we go.

08:48
We have tested the form by entering and updating data.

08:54
Here is an assignment-
Design a form to show the member's information. 

09:00
Make the form look compact.

09:03
Make the font bold.

09:07
Add Save and New record buttons.

09:10
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Form Data in LibreOffice Base.

09:17
To summarize, we learned how to:

09:20
enter and update data in a form.
