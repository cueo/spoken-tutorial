Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

00:04
In this tutorial, we will learn how to

00:07
 create a Table by-

00:09
a) Creating Views and

00:11
b) Using the Copy method.

00:13
Let's go to our Library database.

00:16
Let us click on the Tables icon on the left panel.

00:21
On the right panel, we see three ways of creating a table.

00:26
We will go through the Create View option now.

00:30
Before that, let us learn about Views. What is a View?

00:36
A view is similar to a table but it does not hold the data.

00:43
It is defined as a Query Expression, which is simply retrieval of data from tables or other views from the database.

00:54
So, when viewed, it has columns and rows of data just like a table.

01:00
Views can be used to allow limited access

01:06
or hide the structure and names of the underlying table columns and table data.

01:13
For example, we can create a simple view which will list all the members of the library

01:21
and we can leave out their phone numbers to maintain confidentiality.

01:27
Here the underlying table would be Members.

01:32
Other users of the Library database can be allowed to access this view but not the Members table.

01:40
In this way, we can only see the names of the members and not their phone numbers.

01:46
Okay, let us go back to the main Base window and create this view.

01:53
Let us click on Create View on the right panel.

01:58
We see a new window called the View Design and a pop-up window that says Add tables.

02:06
Let us click on Members

02:09
and close this pop-up window.

02:12
Now, we are in the View design window.

02:16
And we will double-click on the MemberId and the Name fields.

02:21
Adding the 'Id' field is always useful

02:25
because this helps us to join this view with any other related table, for example- the BooksIssued Table.

02:34
We can add functions, criteria and sort it any way we want.

02:40
But for now, we will sort the member names in ascending order.

02:45
For this, let us click on the empty cell in the Sort row under the Name column in the bottom section.

02:54
And then click on ‘ascending’.

02:58
Let us save our first view.

03:01
Here, let us type a descriptive name for this view- View: Members Name Only.

03:10
And let us click on the OK button.

03:14
To see the underlying data, let us click on the Edit menu at the top

03:22
and then click on Run Query at the bottom.

03:27
And we see a new section at the top that lists all the members of the 'Library' in ascending order.

03:36
Note that we don’t see any phone numbers.

03:40
And there is our simple view.

03:43
We can create and design views according to our requirements.

03:48
Before moving on to the next topic, here is an assignment.

03:53
Create a View of 'Books Issued' to Members and only those books that are not checked-in.

04:01
Include in the view, the following fields: Book Titles, Member Names, Issue Date and Return Date.

04:12
Name the view as 'View: List of Books not checked in'.

04:20
Okay, let us learn to create tables by using the copy method.

04:25
This is an easy way of creating tables, if we know that the table structures are going to be very similar.

04:33
For this, let us assume that our Library has DVDs and CDs.

04:39
And we can store this data in a new table called Media.

04:44
A CD or a DVD can have a title and a publish-year for example.

04:51
In order to distinguish between an audio and a video, we will introduce a MediaType field.

05:00
Now, since the Books table has almost similar fields, we can copy-paste the Books table

05:08
and then we can rename the fields and the table name in the process.

05:14
We’ll see how.

05:16
Let us go to the main Base window.

05:19
Here, let us right-click on the Books table

05:23
and we will see the Copy option. Let us click on it.

05:28
And then right-click on it.

05:31
Notice the various options here. There is a Paste and  also there is a Paste Special.

05:39
We can use copy and paste in a specific format.

05:44
Possible formats are Formatted text, HTML or a Data Source Table.

05:51
So, we can choose the database table here

05:55
or we can choose Paste from the right-click menu.

05:59
This opens a wizard and in this window,

06:03
we will first rename our table by typing in ‘Media’ against the table name.

06:11
In the options, we will click on 'Definition and data'.

06:16
Let us click on the Next button.

06:19
In the next window, we will add the columns.

06:23
Let us choose BookId, title and publish-year for this demonstration.

06:29
Now, we will select these fields on the left and use the single arrow button to move them to the right side

06:39
and click on Next button.

06:42
In the next window, we see our columns.

06:46
Here, we can rename the fields and change their data types.

06:51
We will rename the BookId to MediaId.

06:55
And we will click on the Create button.

06:59
In the main Base window, there is our new Media table.

07:05
Let us now edit the table to add a new field MediaType  which will hold the audio or the video type information.

07:15
Now, we are in the Table Design window.

07:19
Here, let us introduce MediaType as the last column.

07:24
Let us click on the cell below publishyear

07:27
and enter 'MediaType’ as Field Name and then choose Text or Field Type.

07:36
Now, let us save the table design and we are done.

07:41
There, we just created our Media table by using the Copy method.

07:48
Okay, here is another assignment.

07:51
Create a table using the ‘Use Wizard to Create table’ method.

07:57
Here, use the ‘Assets’ sample table and rename it to ‘AssetsCopy’

08:04
and explore the various options in this method.

08:08
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Creating Tables in LibreOffice Base.

08:14
To summarize, we learned how to-

08:17
Create a Table by
a) Creating Views and
b) Using the Copy method.
