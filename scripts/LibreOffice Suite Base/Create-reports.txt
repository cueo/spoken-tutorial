Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

00:03
In this tutorial, we will learn how to:

00:07
* Create a report.
 Select, Label and Sort the report fields.


00:12
* Select report layout and choose report type: static or dynamic.

00:19
For this, let us consider our familiar Library database example.

00:27
Here, we have stored information about books and members in this Library database.

00:36
We also have a table to track the books issued to the members.

00:42
We learnt how to create forms and queries in the previous tutorials.

00:48
Before learning how to create a report, let us first learn what a report is?

00:56
A report is another way to retrieve information from a database, similar to a query.

01:05
We can customize its layout, look and feel so that it is easy to read or print on paper.

01:14
Reports can be generated from the database’s tables or queries.

01:21
They can also contain all the fields in the table or in the query or only a selected group of fields.

01:32
There are two categories of reports - static and dynamic.

01:38
Whenever a Static report is opened for viewing,

01:42
it will always display the same data which was there at the time the report was created.

01:48
This is also known as a snapshot.

01:52
But a Dynamic report will show current data from the database, whenever it is opened for viewing.

02:00
Okay, now, let us create a sample report.

02:05
In the 'Library' database,

02:08
let us click on the Reports icon on the left panel.

02:12
On the right panel, let us click on ‘Use Wizard to create report’.

02:18
This is an easy and fast option to build reports.

02:24
We now see a new window which is also called the Report Builder window

02:31
and we also see a wizard with 6 steps listed on the left hand side.

02:39
We will go through the wizard to create a report based on a query we created in the last tutorial-

02:47
'History of books issued to the Library members’.

02:51
We are in Step 1 - Field Selection.

02:56
We will specify the source of the report data here: either a table or a query.

03:05
Let us choose our query: ‘History of Books Issued to Members’ from the drop-down list at the top.

03:14
Now we see a list of available fields from the query on the left hand side.

03:21
We want all the fields in our report; so we'll simply click on the double-arrow button towards the right.

03:30
Now let us click on the Next button to go to the next step.

03:35
Step 2. Labelling Fields.

03:39
Let us type the following descriptive labels in the label text-boxes as shown in the image.

03:50
Okay, let us click on the Next button now.

03:55
We are in Step 3 - Grouping.

03:59
This is used whenever we need to group the data by a set of selected fields.

04:05
For example- in our report, we can group the data by Book titles.

04:12
If we do that, then in the report we will see a book title and then all the members that it was issued to.

04:22
Then we will see the next book title, and so on.

04:27
For now, let us keep our report simple.

04:31
So, we will simply click on the Next button.

04:36
Now, we are in 'Step 4 - Sorting Options'.

04:41
Let us sort the data in chronological order.

04:46
And then sort it by the Book title in ascending order.

04:52
For this, we will click the Sort by drop-down box

04:58
and then click on Issue Date.

05:03
Then we will click on the second drop-down box

05:08
and then click on the Book Title.

05:12
Now, let us click on the Next button.

05:16
Okay. Step 5.- Choose Layout.

05:20
We can customize the look and feel of the report here.

05:25
Let us click on the ‘Columnar, single-column’ layout list.

05:31
Notice that the background Report Builder has refreshed.

05:36
It shows all the labels on the left and corresponding fields on the right.

05:43
Let us now click on the ‘Columnar, two columns’.

05:48
Again the window below has refreshed to show a two column layout.

05:54
In this way, we can choose any of the layouts that Base Wizard provides.

06:02
We can also modify it later as per our requirement.

06:07
For now, we will click on the first item- ‘Tabular’

06:12
and click on the Next button.

06:16
Okay, last step  - 'Create Report'.

06:20
Let us give a descriptive title to our report here: "Books Issued to Members: Report History".

06:30
Now let us design our report so that the report will always return the latest data from the database.

06:38
For this, let us click on the Dynamic Report option

06:45
as we would always like to see the latest data, whenever we open the report for viewing.

06:52
Okay, we are done with our Report. Let us click on the Create Report now option

06:59
and finally click on the Finish button.

07:05
Now we see a new window and this is the Report that we built just now.

07;12
Notice that it has the field labels at the top,  in bold font and the actual data is listed in a tabular fashion.

07:24
Also notice that it has been sorted by the Issue Date field in ascending order that is, chronologically and then by 'Book Title' in ascending order.

07:38
Thus we have created our chronological report of books issued to the Library members.

07:46
In the next tutorial, we will learn how to modify our report.

07:52
Here is an assignment:

07;54
Create a report of all the books in the library grouped by their Publishers.

08;01
Both Publishers and Book titles need to be in ascending order.

08:07
Use the Columnar, Single-column layout.

08:11
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Reports in LibreOffice Base.

08:17
To summarize, we learned how to:

08:21
* Create a Report

08;22
* Select, Label and Sort the report fields

08;25
* Select report layout

08:26
And * choose report type: static or dynamic.
