Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

00:04
In this tutorial, we will cover Tables and Relationships in LibreOffice Base.

00:10
Here, we will learn about: * adding data to a Table.

00:16
* Define and create relationships.

00:19
In the previous LibreOffice Base tutorial, we introduced Base, database basics and learnt how to create a database and a table.

00:31
During the course of the tutorial, we also created an example database called Library and created a 'Books' table as well.

00:42
In this tutorial, we will resume with the Library database and learn how to add data to a table.

00:51
For this, let us invoke the LibreOffice Base program.

00:57
For this, we will click on the Start button at the bottom left of the screen,

01:03
click on All programs, then click on LibreOffice Suite and LibreOffice Base.

01:12
Since we already created the 'Library' database in the last tutorial, this time we will just need to open it.

01:21
To do so, let us click on the open an existing database file option.

01:28
In the Recently Used drop-down box, our 'Library' database should be visible.

01:35
So now, click on the Finish button.

01:38
If you don't see it, we can click on the Open button in the centre to browse to the Windows directory where 'Library database' is saved.

01:50
Once found, click on the filename and click on the Open button.

01:57
Now, if 'LibreOffice Base' program is already open, we can open the 'Library database' from here.

02:07
By clicking on the File menu on the top and then clicking on Open.

02:14
We will browse the Windows directory where the 'Library' database file is saved.

02:21
Let's click on the file 'Library.odb' and click on the Open button at the bottom.

02:31
Now we are in the Library Database.

02:35
Let us click on the Tables icon in the Database list on the left panel.

02:42
Notice that the Books table appears in the Tables list on the right panel.

02:48
Let us now right-click on the Books table.

02:53
Notice the various options you can choose from here.

02:58
Let us now click on Open to add data to this table.

03:04
Alternately, we can also double-click on the table name to open it.

03:10
A new window opens with the title 'Books – Library – LibreOffice Base: Table Data View'.

03:20
Now we can start entering data into the Books table by typing in values directly into each cell.

03:31
Notice the Bookid column has 'AutoField'.

03:37
This means Base will assign ascending numbers automatically to each row of data that we insert.

03:48
Now, let us  input data into the cells, row by row, as shown on the screen.

04:22
So, here we have 5 rows of sample data in our table 'Books'.

04:29
Let us close the window by clicking the File menu on the top and then choosing Close.

04:39
Here is an assignment for you.

04:42
Create a Members table that will store information about each member, for example- member name', and phone number.

04:53
Include the following three fields.

04:57
Member Id with Field type- Integer and make this the primary key.

05:06
Name with Fieldtype- Text,

05:10
Phone with Fieldtype- Text.

05:15
Okay, when you are done, this is how the Members table will look like.

05:22
Let us close this window.

05:25
Now let us add 4 sample members into the Members table now as shown on the screen ,

05:35
just the way we did for the Books table. <pause for 10 seconds>

05:46
Once done, let us close this window.

05:50
Now, let us go back to the main window and click on the Tables Icon again

05:57
and let us create the third table: Books Issued.

06:04
When done, the Books Issued table will have the following fields:

06:09
Issue Id, Field type Integer which will be the primary key,

06:16
Book Id, Field type-Integer,

06:20
Member Id, Field type-Integer,

06:24
Issue Date, Field type- Date,

06:28
Return Date, Field type-Date,

06:31
Actual Return Date, Field type- Date,

06:35
And Checked In, Field type- Yes/No Boolean.

06:42
Okay, we have created the Books Issued table.

06:47
And now, let us add the following sample data into it as you can see on the screen.

06:56
While this may not make absolute sense right now, we will soon understand what’s happening.

07:17
Now, we have the three tables in our Library database with sample data also.

07:25
Let us now learn about defining relationships in the database.

07:31
So, we created three tables to store three different sets of information.

07:38
Books, Members and Issue of Books to Members.

07:44
Now we also set up columns to uniquely identify each book, each member and each book issued in these three tables.

07:57
They are the Primary Keys.

08:00
One of the various advantages of a primary key is that it helps to establish relationships between tables.

08:10
But why do we need relationships?

08:13
Let us look at the Books Issued table. Here, we see the Book-Id and Member-Id fields.

08:23
They can have any value in the Books Issued table.

08:28
But, they will need to correspond to the same values as we have in the Books and Members tables respectively.

08:38
So if the book, Macbeth, has its 'Book Id' as 3 in the 'Books' table

08:45
then by using 3 in the 'Book Id' of the 'Books Issued' table, we will still be referring to the same book.

08:56
So, to explicitly connect these two tables, we will still need to link them someway.

09:05
Also, for example- How will you establish that 'Macbeth' was issued to Ravi Kumar on 2nd June 2011?

09:16
Or how will you ensure that a book is issued to only members of the library and not anyone else?

09:25
All of these can be achieved by setting up relationships which help interlink the data.

09:34
We will need to force Base to use values from the 'Books' table and the 'Members' table only, by linking the appropriate fields.

09:46
Let us see how.

09:48
In the 'LibreOffice Base' main window, let us click on Tools and then click on Relationships.

09:58
This opens a small pop-up window.

10:03
Here, we will select the top most table and click on the Add button and repeat for the other two tables also.

10:15
Close the pop-up window.

10:18
Now we see the three tables Books, Books Issued and Members in a line.

10:26
By clicking, dragging and dropping, let us introduce more space among the tables.

10:35
Now, let us click on the Book-Id in the Books table and drag and drop it on the Book Id in the Books Issued table.

10:48
Notice a line connecting these two field names. So there, we have set up one relationship!

10:57
Let us repeat the same for Member-Id.

11:02
Click on the Member-Id in the Members table and drag and drop it in the Books Issued table.

11:11
You can see that we just created two relationships.

11:16
And, this is how we establish relationships

11:20
And therefore interlink meaningful data stored in various tables in the relational database.

11:30
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Tables and Relationships in LibreOffice.

11:36
To summarize, we learned how to: Add data to a table, Define and create relationships.
