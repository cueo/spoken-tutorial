Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

00:04
In this tutorial, we will learn about * What is LibreOffice Base?

00:09
* Prerequisites for using Base

00:12
* What can you do with Base?

00:14
* Relational Database basics, Create a new database, Create a table.

00:20
LibreOffice Base is the database front-end of the LibreOffice suite.

00:26
Base is the equivalent of Microsoft Access.

00:30
Base is free and open source software, free of cost and free to use and distribute.

00:37
Let us look at the prerequisites for using 'Base'.

00:41
Following are the System requirements for Microsoft Windows:

00:45
Microsoft Windows 2000 (Service Pack 4 or higher), XP, Vista or Windows 7, Pentium-compatible PC up to 1.5 Gb available hard disk space.

01:02
For Ubuntu Linux, here are the System requirements:

01:06
Linux kernel version 2.6.18 or higher, Pentium-compatible PC.

01:13
For both, Windows and Linux installation, we require 256 Mb RAM (recommended 512 Mb).

01:24
For complete system requirements, visit the Libreoffice website.

01:30
You will also need to install Java Runtime Environment which you can download at the following link.

01:38
Click on the red button in the centre that says 'Free Java Download'.

01:44
Once the file is downloaded, double-click on it and follow the instructions to install.

01:52
Let us now look at LibreOffice Base installation:

01:56
If you have already installed 'LibreOffice Suite' with the complete installation option

02:03
then you can access LibreOffice Base by clicking on the Start menu at the bottom left of your screen.

02:12
Click on All Programs and then click on LibreOffice Suite.

02:21
If you have not installed LibreOffice Suite,

02:24
you can install Base by visiting the official website and clicking on the green area that says  'Download LibreOffice'.

02:37
Detailed instructions are available in the first tutorial of LibreOffice Suite.

02:43
Remember, when installing, use the Complete option to install 'Base'.

02:50
Okay, let us go to the next topic now.

02:54
What can you do with LibreOffice Base?

02:57
With Base - * you can store organized data

03:02
* perform data entries and view data using forms

03:08
* retrieve information using queries and

03:12
* design and generate nice, printer-ready reports.

03:17
Base helps you to manage databases.

03:21
As you may know, a database is a group of data, forms, queries and reports.

03:29
For example, 'Base' can be used to manage Customer Information databases,

03:36
track sales orders and invoices, maintain student grade databases or build a library database.

03:47
Let us now learn about some basics of databases.

03:51
A database has data stored and organized into tables.

03:56
Tables have individual pieces of data, stored in rows and columns.

04:03
Such a database is also called a relational database where the tables have relationships with each other using the columns.

04:15
Let us consider a simple database for a Library.

04:20
A library can be a collection of Books.

04:23
And books can be issued to members of the library.

04:28
A book can have a Title, an Author, a Publisher, Year of publication and a Price.

04:37
These are called characteristics or attributes.

04:42
Similarly, a Library member has a Name, Phone number and an Address.

04:48
And the library issues books to its members only.

04:54
Now, let us see how we can store this data as individual tables of rows and columns.

05:02
Information about each book can be stored in a Books table,

05:08
with its attributes becoming the columns: book Title, Author, Publisher, Year of publication and Price.

05:19
To distinguish each book, let us also add a unique identifier column called BookId.

05:27
This way, we can have two completely different books with the same title.

05:33
Similarly, a Members table can have columns like Name and Phone

05:40
and a Member Id to uniquely identify or distinguish each member. <pause>

05:47
And we can track the books issued to members in a third table called BooksIssued.

05:56
This table will track the book issued, the member, date of issue, date of return, actual date of return, whether checked-in or not.

06:09
We can establish relationships among these tables, to interlink the data in them.

06:16
Now, this helps us to manage relational databases.

06:22
For advanced topics on relational databases, refer to our other tutorials by visiting the website Spoken tutorial.org.

06:35
Okay, let us now get started with our first Base database called “Library”!

06:43
To create a new database, let us first open the Base program.

06:50
Then, click on the Windows Start menu at the bottom left of the screen. Then click on All Programs, then LibreOffice Suite and LibreOffice Base.

07:08
A pop-up window titled Database Wizard opens.

07:13
Click on the Next button to create a new database.

07:19
Click on the Finish button in the following window.

07:23
This opens a Save As window.

07:27
Since we are building a Library database, we will type "Library" in the File Name text-box

07:35
and then click on the Save button.

07:39
Now, we are in..

07:42
Next, let us create tables to store data.

07:46
To create a new table, click the Tables icon in the Database list on the left.

07:54
Click on the 'Create Table in Design View' in the Tasks list on the right. This opens another window.

08:05
Here, type "BookId" as the first column under Field Name.

08:13
Use the Tab key to move to the Field Type column.

08:18
Since the BookId will be a different number for each book, select Integer as the Field Type from the drop-down list.

08:32
Change the Field Properties in the bottom section.

08:36
Change AutoValue from "No" to "Yes".

08:41
This field now will uniquely identify each book.

08:46
In other words, this field is also called the Primary Key.

08:52
Notice the yellow key symbol to the left of the BookId field.

08:58
Let us see how we can choose Field Types for Field names.

09:05
Field types can be text, integer, numeric, decimal or date.

09:13
Use Text for fields that have general information, for example- name, title, address.

09:22
Use Integer, numeric, decimal for fields that may contain only numbers.

09:30
For example- use numeric for a field with price information, Integer for years.

09:39
Let us create the rest of the fields now.

09:43
Title- Field type: Text, Author-

09:52
Field type: Text, Published Year-

09:59
Field type: Integer,

10:05
Publisher-

10:09
Field type: Text,

10:11
Price-

10:14
Field type: Numeric.

10:18
Change the Length to 5 and Decimal places to 2.

10:25
Click the Format example button.

10:29
This opens the Field Format window.

10:33
Select Currency from the Category list and  INR from the Format list.

10:42
Let us choose Rs. 1234.00 that has two decimal places.

10:54
Notice that the total length is five, inclusive of the two decimal places.

11:02
Click on the OK button. Now we have created all the columns for the Books table.

11:11
Let us now save the table.

11:14
Click on the Save icon that is below the File menu.

11:20
Type "Books" in the Table Name text-box.

11:25
Note that it is saved in the same location as the database ‘Library’, as tables are a part of a database.

11:36
And click on the OK button.

11:39
In the next tutorial, we will add data to the Books table and create the Members and BooksIssued tables.

11:50
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

11:54
To summarize, we covered the following:

11:58
* What is LibreOffice Base?

12:01
* Prerequisites for using Base

12:03

12:08
* Create a new database, create a table.
