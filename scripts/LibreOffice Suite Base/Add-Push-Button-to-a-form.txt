Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

00:03
In this tutorial, we will learn how to add a Push Button to a form.

00:10
In the last tutorial, we learnt how to add a list box form control to a form.

00:17
Now in this tutorial, we will learn how to add push buttons to a form.

00:24
Let us first invoke the LibreOffice Base program, if it's not already open

00:36
and open our 'Library' database. You probably know how to open an existing database by now.

00:45
Click Open under the File menu and choose Library database.

00:52
Now we are in the Library database.

00:56
Let us open the 'Books Issued to Members' form that we were working with, in the last tutorial.

01:04
To do this, let us click on the Forms icon on the left panel

01:09
and then right-click on the 'Books Issued to Members' form on the right panel.

01:16
Now click on Edit.

01:19
We are now in the Form Design window.

01:23
Before we talk about adding Push buttons to our form, let us make some way for the second list box for Member names.

01:34
Remember, we had an assignment of creating the second list box in the previous tutorial.

01:41
First, let us remove the text-box that is on the right of the Member Name label

01:50
by right-clicking on this text-box and then clicking on Cut.

01:57
The text-box is deleted.

02:00
Next, let us arrange the form elements.

02:04
Since list-boxes need more space than text-boxes, we will push the form elements further down on the form.

02:15
Here is how we will do it.

02:17
First let us select all the form elements that are below the Book title label.

02:26
For this, we will use the click, drag and drop method.

02:32
Next, let us click on the selected area and drag it vertically down

02:39
so that there is enough room for the first list-box that is adjacent to the Book Title label.

02:48
Now, let us repeat the same step for the Member Name label as well.

03:05
Now, let us click, drag and drop the second list box, that is to the left of the Member Name label

03:14
and move to its right so that it is aligned with the rest of the form controls nicely.

03:22
Okay, let us save our work on the form so far by using the keyboard shortcut Control, S.

03:32
Now, we are ready to add 'Push buttons' to our form.

03:39
A push button is another example of a form control.

03:44
We are familiar with OK, Cancel, Next and Finish buttons; these are some examples of Push buttons.

03:56
With Base, we can add these Push buttons to our form and instruct Base, to perform specific actions when clicked.

04:07
Again, Save or Undo or Delete are some examples.

04:14
Let us see how.

04:17
Let us now add four push buttons to our form, below all the other form elements, just as in the image shown here.

04:30
To do this, let us go back to our Form Design window.

04:35
And, click once on the Push button icon in the Form Controls toolbar.

04:43
This icon looks like a button with the word OK on it.

04:50
Notice that the mouse pointer looks like a plus symbol.

04:57
Now, let us draw our first button on the bottom left, by clicking, dragging and dropping on the form, below all the other elements.

05:10
And, we will resize it accordingly.

05:14
Now let us repeat the above step three more times.

05:27
And now, we have three more buttons, all aligned in one horizontal line.

05:35
We are done drawing the push buttons on the form; now let us change their labels.

05:43
To do this, double-click on the first button.

05:49
We now see the Properties window. Here, let us type 'Save Record' against the 'Label'.

05:59
Now, let us click on the second button on the form.

06:06
And in the 'Properties window', we will type 'Undo Changes' against the Label.

06:15
For the third and the fourth buttons, let us type 'Delete Record'

06:25
and 'New Record' respectively.

06:31
Now, let us define their actions.

06:37
To do this, let us click on 'Save Record' button

06:43
and in the 'Properties window', let us scroll down until we spot the 'Action' label.

06:51
Here, we will click on the drop-down list box and click on the Save record.

06:59
Let us follow the same steps for the other three buttons.

07:05
For the Undo Changes button, we will choose the Undo data entry Action.

07:12
For the Delete Record button, we will choose the Delete Record Action.

07:18
And for the New Record button, we will choose the New record Action.

07:25
So, now we have added the push buttons.

07:29
Okay, let us save our form by using the keyboard shortcut Control, S and close this window.

07:40
In the next tutorial, we will go through just three more simple modifications to our form

07:47
and then we can use the form for data entry and data updates.

07:54
For example, when a Library member returns a book, we can update this information in the database using this form.

08:06
Here is an assignment:

08:08
Add a fifth push button to the form beside the fourth and when used, it should refresh the form.

08:18
And add 4 narrow push buttons in the next line below. These buttons should  help us navigate through the records.

08:30
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on 'LibreOffice Base'.

08:35
To summarize, we learned how to: Add a Push Button to a form.
