Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

00:04
In this tutorial, we will learn the following topics on database design:

00:09
* Determining the purpose of our database

00:12
* Finding and organizing the information required

00:15
* Dividing the information into tables.

00:19
What is Database Design?

00:21
'Database design' is the process of producing a detailed data model of a database.

00:28
With a good design, a database can

00:32
provide up-to-date, accurate and complete information.

00:37
Which means- we can ensure integrity of our information at various levels,

00:43
meet our needs of data processing and reporting

00:48
and easily accommodate change.

00:51
The process of database design consists of the following steps:

00:57
* Determine the purpose of our database

01:00
* Find and organize the information required

01:04
* Divide the information into tables

01:07
* Turn information items into columns

01:11
* Specify primary keys

01:14
* Set up the table relationships

01:17
* Refine our design

01:20
* Apply the normalization rules

01:23
* And finally, test, run the database and maintain.

01:28
Okay, let us go to the first step which is-

01:32
Determine the purpose of our database.

01:35
Let us consider a simple Library Application.

01:38
A library usually has books.

01:41
And these books are issued to its registered members.

01:45
So, we need a Library application to maintain a list of books and members.

01:51
And track the issuing of this books to its members.

01:56
Our first step is to find and organize the required information.

02:01
Here is where we gather all of the types of information we want to record in the database.

02:09
Now that we know the purpose of the 'Library application', let us identify the items here.

02:17
There are books.

02:19
A Book has a title, an author, a publisher and a price.

02:24
And we can also store the author’s information such as, date of birth and country he or she belongs to.

02:33
We can also store the publisher’s name, address and phone.

02:38
Also,  there are the 'Library' members who have names, phone numbers and addresses.

02:45
Now when a book is issued to a member, there is a-

02:49
book issue date, return date, actual return date and the checked-in status.

02:56
These individual items are also called attributes.

03:01
Each of these attributes represents a potential column in a table.

03:08
At this point, we can formulate questions such as:

03:12
How do we add information about a set of fresh books supplied to the Library by a publisher?

03:20
How do we maintain a list of its members?

03:25
What if a member leaves or a member wants to change his/her address?

03:32
How do we update the information when a book is returned by a member?

03:38
What kind of reports would we want to produce?

03:42
Which books are most read among the readers?

03:46
And how do we generate a list of books which are over due to be returned by members who have borrowed them?

03:55
Now that we have some details, let us see how we can divide the information into tables.

04:02
We will divide our information items or attributes into major entities or subjects.

04:11
Each subject then becomes a table.

04:14
So, the preliminary list of tables looks like the image shown on the screen.

04:21
The major subjects or entities shown here are the books and the members.

04:26
Therefore, it makes sense to start out with two tables, one for books and one for members.

04:33
Let us now look at the Books table in detail.

04:37
It has 10 attributes or columns which we defined earlier:

04:43
Title, Author, Publisher, PublisherAddress, PublisherCity, PublisherPhone, PublishYear, Price, AuthorBirthDate and AuthorCountry.

04:58
Now, let us see how data is displayed in this table.

05:03
Notice that each row or record contains information about the book, its author and its publisher.

05:13
Now, there are two flaws in this design.

05:17
There can be many books from the same author or the publisher.

05:23
So, we notice that the author’s details and the publisher’s details have been repeated many times

05:31
which wastes computer disk space.

05:34
And a second problem with this design is:

05:38
it runs the risk of introducing anomalies in the database.

05:44
Now, what is an anomaly?

05:47
It is simply an error or inconsistency in the database.

05:53
There are three types of anomalies:

05:57
The first is called an insertion anomaly

06:01
which can occur when a new record is inserted.

06:06
Or, when certain attributes cannot be inserted into the database without the presence of other attributes.

06:14
For example, we will suppose there is a new Publisher called 'Penguin'.

06:21
Now, our design will not let us insert details about Penguin publishers until our library can get a hold of at least one book by them.

06:34
The second is called the deletion anomaly

06:39
which occurs during the deletion of a record.

06:43
Here, the deletion of a row or record in the database deletes more information than we wished to delete.

06:51
For example, we see that the 'Orient Publishers' have only one book titled ‘Paradise Lost’, in our library.

07:01
Now, if we delete this entire record then we lose all information on Orient Publishers.

07:10
And we lose information about the author John Milton as well.

07:16
And finally, let us see what Update Anomaly is.

07:21
It occurs during the updating of a record.

07:26
For example, let us suppose that Cambridge Publishers have a new address.

07:32
Now, updating the Address column for this Publisher requires us to make a change in more than one place.

07:40
In our case, two places.

07:43
And, if Cambridge supplied a thousand books then it means, we need to change the address in those thousand records.

07:54
And we might accidentally change the address in one place but forget to change it in the other places.

08:02
So, this can lead to information not being accurate and thereby data integrity is lost.

08:11
How do we solve these problems?

08:14
We should redesign so that we record each fact just once.

08:20
If the same information is repeated in more than one place then we should place that information in a separate table.

08:29
Let us see how.

08:31
Now we have split the Books table into Books, Authors and Publisher.

08:38
Notice that the columns in each table store facts about that entity or subject only.

08:47
This way, we can record the publisher information only once inside the Publisher table.

08:55
Similarly, having a separate Authors table allows recording the author information only once.

09:04
And we will see how we can link these tables back to the Books table in the next tutorial.

09:12
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on the first part of Database Design in LibreOffice.

09:19
To summarize, we learned the following topics on database design:

09:25
* Determining the purpose of our database

09:28
*Finding and organizing the information required

09:32
*Dividing the information into tables.
