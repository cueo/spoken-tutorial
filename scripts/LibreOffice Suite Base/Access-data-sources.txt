Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

00:04
In this tutorial, we will learn how to:

00:08
* Access other Data Sources

00:10
* Register '.odb' databases

00:15
* View Data sources

00:17
And * Use Data Sources in Writer.

00:22
Let us see how we can access other Data Sources in Base.

00:28
Libre Office allows other data sources to be accessed apart from Base Databases.

00:37
It also allows to link them into other Libre Office documents.

00:43
For example, we can access a spreadsheet or a simple text document from inside LibreOffice Base.

00:53
And then link them into a LibreOffice Writer document.

00:58
As an example, let us create an example spreadsheet using LibreOffice Calc.

01:06
Click on Start Menu >> All Programs and open the LibreOffice Suite menu.

01:16
Or, if LibreOffice is already open then we can click on File, New and then Spreadsheet to open a new spreadsheet.

01:30
Now, in the spreadsheet, let us type in some sample data as shown in the image. <pause>

01:46
And save this spreadsheet as ‘LibraryMembers’ in a directory location.

01:54
Now, let us remember the location as we will need to use this file later in our example.

02:02
And we will close the Calc window.

02:07
Okay, now let us see how we can access this spreadsheet from 'LibreOffice Base'.

02:15
To do this, open Base either from Windows Start menu

02:25
or if LibreOffice is already open then we will click on File, New and then Database.

02:36
Now, this opens the Database Wizard.

02:39
Here, we will click on the ‘Connect to an existing database’

02:45
then click on the drop-down.

02:48
Notice the various database sources in this list that Base can access.

02:55
And we will click on Spreadsheet here.

02:59
And the Next button.

03:02
Now, using the browse button, let us locate the spreadsheet from where we saved it earlier.

03:10
If there is a password for the spreadsheet, we will need to provide it too.

03:16
Here we won’t need it.

03:19
Let us click on the Next button.

03:22
Now let us register the spreadsheet as a data source

03:27
and open it for editing.

03:32
And, click on the Finish button.

03:36
Now, let us provide a database name here. Let us type in "LibraryMembers".

03:44
Notice the Save as type: It says ODF Database which is '.odb' in our case.

03:56
And Save it in the same location as the spreadsheet.

04:01
There we have registered the spreadsheet as a data source in Base.

04:07
We are in the main Base window now.

04:11
Here, let us click on the Tables icon in the left panel.

04:16
Notice the tables ‘Sheet1’, Sheet2, and 'Sheet3'.

04:23
Let us double-click on Sheet1 to open it and here is the data from the spreadsheet.

04:31
Now, with this method of accessing the Spreadsheet, we cannot make any changes from here.

04:39
We can only view data or create queries and reports based on the existing data from here.

04:47
So, changes have to be made directly to the Spreadsheet itself.

04:54
Registering '.odb' databases.

04:59
Now, there are other programs such as OpenOffice.org that can produce '.odb' databases.

05:11
To use these inside LibreOffice Base, we will first need to register them in Base.

05:19
To register any '.odb' database, we will need to open Base and

05:28
choose Tools, Options, LibreOffice Base and Databases.

05:36
Under Registered Databases, click New.

05:42
Browse to where the database is located and ensure the registered name is correct

05:51
and Click on the OK button.

05:55
Let us see how we can view Data sources in LibreOffice.

06:01
For this, let us consider the example spreadsheet that we registered in Base.

06:07
Now, we can use it in LibreOffice Writer or Calc.

06:12
For example, let us see how we can view it inside 'LibreOffice Writer'.

06:19
First, let us open Writer from the 'Base' window.

06:24
For this, let us click on File, New and then Text Document.

06:33
Now we are in the Writer window.

06:36
To view the available data sources, we will click on the View menu at the top and click on Data Sources.

06:46
Alternately, we can press the F4 key.

06:52
Now we see a list of registered databases at the top left, including "LibraryMembers" which we created just now.

07:03
To view the database, we will expand it by clicking on the plus symbol on the left of the database name

07:14
and we will expand Tables.

07:18
Here are Sheet1, 2 and 3.

07:24
Let us click on Sheet 1.

07:28
So, that’s our data at the top right of the Writer window.

07:36
Now we will see how we can use this data in our example Writer document.

07:43
Okay, here if we want to use all of the data from the table above then first we will select all the records there.

07:55
For this, let us click on the gray cell to the left of the first column in the first record.

08:05
Then, while pressing Shift key, we will click on the gray cell to the left of the first column in the last record.

08:17
Notice that all the data gets highlighted.

08:21
Now we will click, drag and drop this onto the Writer document below.

08:30
Next, we see a pop-up window titled Insert Database columns.

08:37
So here, we will click on the Table option at the top

08:42
and then click on the double-arrow button to move all the fields from the left to the right list.

08:52
Notice the various choices here.

08:56
For now, we will simply click on the OK button.

09:00
And here is the entire table of data in the document.

09:05
Next, let us see how we can insert individual fields.

09:13
Let us go to the top of the Writer document and press the Enter key twice. Again, go to the top left.

09:22
Here, let us type in "Member Name" colon.

09:28
And then click on the Name column in the data sources area at the top right.

09:36
Now we will click, drag and drop it next to the text we typed.

09:43
And we will press the Tab key and type in "Phone number" colon.

09:51
And..... we know what to do, don’t we?

09:55
We will click and drag the Phone column from the top and drop it next to our text.

10:04
Then let us highlight the first record by clicking the gray cell to the left of the first record.

10:13
And then, we will click on the Data to Fields icon.

10:19
This can be found in the Table Data toolbar at the top, below the Formatting toolbar.

10:27
Notice that the data in the table above is now in the Writer document.

10:35
To bring in another record, we just have to highlight a different record and use the Data to Fields icon again.

10:46
So, there we learnt how to use data sources inside LibreOffice documents.

10:54
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Accessing other Data Sources in LibreOffice Base.

11:01
To summarize, we learned how to:

11:05
* Access other Data Sources

11:07
* Register .odb databases

11:12
* View Data sources

11:14
* And Use Data Sources in Writer.
