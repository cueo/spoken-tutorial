Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

00:03
In this tutorial, we will learn the following topics:
 Indexes
 Table Filter
 And the SQL Command window.


00:14
Let us first learn about Indexes.

00:16
What is an Index?

00:18
An Index is a way to find and sort records within a database table faster.

00:26
We can choose one field or multiple fields in a table on which the records need to be indexed.

00:36
The Index stores the location of records based on the chosen field or fields.

00:43
So, to retrieve data, Base can move to the location of the data directly by using the index.

00:51
And so, it is considerably faster than scanning through all of the records to find the data.

00:59
The primary key of a table is automatically indexed.

01:03
Now, let us create an index in our example Library database.

01:09
We will create an index on the Title column in the Books table that will speed up searching on book titles.

01:18
Let us first open our 'Library' database, if not already opened.

01:34
And open the Books table in Edit mode.

01:39
In the Table Design window, let us go to the Tools menu and choose Index Design.

01:48
In the Indexes window, notice that Base already has included the Primary Key as a Unique Index.

01:57
Let us click on the left most icon, New Index, to create our index.

02:05
And choose Title in the drop-down list under the Index field on the right.

02:14
We can also choose the Ascending or Descending order here

02:19
and rename this index to ‘IDX_Title’ by clicking on the third icon on the left and save it using the Save icon next to it.

02:37
So, there is our index on the Title field.

02:42
In this way we can create, edit, rename or delete indexes for tables using Base.

02:51
Here is an assignment for you:

02:54
Create an index on names in the Members table and call it ‘IDX_MemberName’.

03:03
Next, let us see what a Table Filter is.

03:07
'Table Filter' feature allows us to hide tables in a Base database from other applications.

03:15
As an example, let us hide all tables except the Books table in the 'Library' database.

03:22
Now, Table Filter is available under the Tools menu.

03:27
Here, let us check All Views and check the Books table.

03:33
Meaning, we are marking only the Books table to be visible to other applications.

03:39
Now, let us click on the OK button.

03:43
Next, click on the View menu and then on Refresh Tables.

03:50
Notice that Books is the only table visible here.

03:54
Also, when accessing this database from LibreOffice Writer or Calc, we will only see the Books table there.

04:04
Here is another assignment:

04:06
1. Open LibreOffice Writer, access the Library database and check the tables available there.

04:14
2. Bring back all the tables to visibility in Base.

04:19
3. And reopen 'LibreOffice Writer' to check the tables’ availability again.

04:26
Finally, let us learn about the SQL command window.

04:31
The 'SQL command window' is accessed by choosing SQL from the Tools menu.

04:41
We can use this window to issue SQL statements to the database.

04:47
Now, we can also use Queries to execute SQL queries but there we are limited to only asking for data from the database.

04:59
Meaning, we can issue only SELECT statements there.

05:04
But we cannot execute SQL statements which modify data and table structures or to create new tables there.

05:14
And the 'SQL command window' helps us to use such data manipulation and data definition statements or language.

05:24
Examples of Data Manipulation Language or simply DML are:

05:31
INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE data.

05:37
And some examples of Data Definition Language or simply DDL are:

05:45
CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE and ALTER statements.

05:51
We will first see a DML example.

05:55
In the Base window, let us open the SQL Command Window from the Tools menu.

06:02
Let us insert a new record into the Books table by typing in the “Command to execute” text area:

06:12
INSERT INTO "Books" ( "Title", "Author", "PublishYear", "Publisher", "Price")
VALUES ('The Hobbit', 'J.R.R Tolkien', 2002, 'Oxford', 500);

06:45
Before clicking on the Execute button, let us look at the command closely now.

06:52
The INSERT statement lists the table name and the field names and then the Values that need to go into the new record.

07:03
Notice that the table name and field names are enclosed in double quotes.

07:11
We know that Base is case sensitive and the double quotes ensure that Base will accept the names as we created.

07:22
If we don’t use the quotes, Base will automatically convert all names into upper cases.

07:31
We have to use single quotes to encase the values that are of data type TEXT.

07:37
NUMERIC fields need not be encased with any quotes.

07:43
Also, we need not include the BookId field which is an AutoNumber field.

07:51
Base will take care of auto-generating the number.

07:56
So, let us execute the SQL. Notice the message ‘Command successfully executed’.

08:05
If there are any errors with the SQL we wrote, Base will point them out.

08:12
Let us double-click on the Books table and look for the new record we just inserted.

08:18
There it is, appended in the last row.

08:23
Next, let us see a DDL example.

08:27
We will create a new table called Authors with fields AuthorId, Author and Country.

08:36
In the SQL command window, let us type as shown in the screen

08:43
and execute it.

08:47
Let us go back to the Tables list and Refresh the tables from the View menu.

08:54
There is the new Authors table we just created.

08:59
To know more about DML, visit the website shown on the screen.

09:06
To know more about DDL visit the Wikipedia website shown on the screen.

09:13
Here is another assignment for you:

09:16
1. Use the UPDATE statement to set the price of the book with BookId as 3, to Rs. 300

09:26
2. Delete the book that has the title ‘'The Hobbit'

09:30
3. Insert a new record into the Authors table, author name as ‘J.R.R. Tolkien’, and country as‘England’

09:41
4. Drop the Authors table from the database by using the DROP statement.

09:47
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

09:52
To summarize, we learned the following topics:
 Indexes
 Table Filter
 And the SQL Command window.
