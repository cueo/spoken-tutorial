Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

00:06
In this tutorial, we will learn how to

00:09
modify a report by customizing the layout and the look and feel of the report.

00:16
For this, let us consider our familiar Library database example.

00:23
In the previous tutorial, we learnt how to create a report.

00:28
And we built a report with the title ‘Books Issued to Members: Report History’. We will now learn how to modify this report.

00:40
In the 'Library' database,

00:42
let us click on the Reports icon on the left panel.

00:47
On the right panel, we see the ‘Books Issued to Members: Report History’ report in the reports list.

00:57
Let us right-click on it and then click on Edit to open the report for modifying or editing.

01:08
We now see a new window which is called the Report Builder window.

01:14
This screen is composed of three main sections.

01:19
Page Header and Footer section that form the top and the bottom.

01:26
Then the Header section

01:29
and the Detail section.

01:34
We can also add a record header and a footer section

01:40
by right-clicking on the main screen in the white area and clicking on the ‘Insert Report Header/Footer’.

01:51
We can shrink or expand these sections by double-clicking on the orange areas on the left of the screen.

02:00
Before we move on, here is a screenshot of the Report design window.

02:06
We will modify our report design to look like this.

02:11
We will add some text labels, fonts, formatting and adjust the spacing among the various sections.

02:20
Okay, now let us add some report headers and footers.

02:27
To do this, we will click on the Label Field icon

02:31
in the Report Controls toolbar, found below the menu bar at the top.

02:40
Let us draw it on the Report Header area, as being shown now

02:48
and double-click on the Label to bring up its properties on the right.

02:55
Here, let us type: "Books Issued to Members:

03:00
Report History" against the Label and press Enter.

03:07
Let us also change the font style; we will choose Arial Black, Bold and Size 12

03:17
and click on the OK button.

03:21
Next, let us add another label to the report footer as shown on the screen. <pause>

03:31
For example- let's type: "Report Prepared by Assistant Librarian" <pause>

03:42
and then change the font style to Arial, Bold Italic and Size 8. <pause>

03:51
Now, we will repeat the same steps again to add a label in the Page Footer area.  <pause>

03:59
This time, we will type: "Nehru Library, New Delhi" against the label <pause>

04:09
and change the font style to Arial, Bold Italic and Size 8. <pause>

04:20
Now, let us adjust the spacing.

04:24
First, let us reduce the Page Header area by double-clicking on the grey line between the Page Header and Report Header.

04:37
And we will take it all the way to the top by using the click, drag and drop method.

04:47
Next, let us reduce the Report header area

04:52
by double-clicking on the grey line between the report header and the header. <pause>

05:01
We will repeat the same steps to reduce the spacing between the Report footer and the Page footer also. <pause>

05:13
Next, let us centre the Header labels.

05:18
We will do this by first selecting all the labels by clicking on the Book Title

05:26
and then while pressing the Shift key, we will click on the rest of the labels as shown.

05:35
Now, let us use the up-arrow key to centre them.

05:41
We will now give the header a light blue background.

05:47
To do this, we will go to the Properties and change the Background transparent to NO.

05:55
And then select Blue 8 from the list for Background colour.

06:03
We will do the same with the Detail section as well. <pause>

06:09
For this, we will first increase the spacing between the Detail and Report footer sections <pause>

06:20
and then centre the fields. <pause>

06:24
We will select Light gray background for the Detail section as shown. <pause>

06:32
Next, we will change the data formatting for the Checked In field.

06:39
Since this holds Boolean values 1 or 0, it displays True or False.

06:47
We will change this to show a friendlier Yes or No option.

06:53
For this, we will double-click on the CheckedIn field on the right, in the Detail section.

07:01
Now, in the properties on the right, let us click on the Data tab first.

07:08
Let us click on the button next to the Data field that says "CheckedIn".

07:15
This opens a new pop-up window called the Function wizard.

07:20
Here, let us first empty the Formula text-box at the bottom right.

07:27
Then click on the Category drop-down and then double-click on ‘IF’.

07:35
Now on the right, we see new controls.

07:40
Let us click on the Select icon on the right, next to the first text box.

07:49
Here we will double-click on CheckIn.

07:53
Next, we will type in Yes within double-quotes in the second text-box.

08:01
And then type in No in the third text-box. <pause>

08:12
Now we will go to the General tab within the Properties section

08:18
and click on the button against Formatting, at the bottom.

08:24
Here, we will click on Text in the Category list

08:28
and then click on the OK button.

08:32
And now, we will save the report.

08:36
Okay, let us run our modified report now.

08:41
For this, we will click on the Edit menu at the top and then click on the Execute Report.

08:50
And there is our nice report history on the "Books issued to the Library members".

08:57
Notice the spacing, headers, footers, fonts

09:01
and the CheckedIn field which says 'Yes' or 'No'.

09:06
And we are done with modifying our report.

09:11
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Modifying a Report in LibreOffice Base.

09:17
To summarize, we learned how to:

09:20
modify a report by customizing the layout and the look and feel of the report.
