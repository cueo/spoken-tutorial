Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

00:04
In this tutorial, we will learn how to

00:07
create a Subform.

00:09
For this, let us continue with our familiar Library database example.

00:15
And we will consider the following case:

00:18
* How can we list all the members of the library?

00:22
* And for each member, how can we see only those books that have not yet been returned by that member?

00:31
One way is to create a form listing all the members in the library.

00:36
And then creating a subform below it, to list those books that have not yet been returned by the member.

00:44
Once we design this form, we will be able to update the form.

00:49
For example, when a member returns a book, we can update this information.

00:55
And, here is a sample screenshot of the form we will design.

01:01
Notice, it also shows a subform at the bottom.

01:06
Let's open our Library database.

01:09
In our previous tutorials, we created the ‘History of Books Issued to Members’ query.

01:17
Now we will use this query and the Members table as the base for creating our new form.

01:25
Let us first copy this query by right-clicking on the query name and then let us click on Paste.

01:34
In the pop-up window for query name, let us type in a new name: ‘Books Not Returned’

01:42
Let us now open the ‘Books Not Returned’ query in edit mode.

01:48
In the Query Design window, let us add a criterion to show only those books that are not checked-in.

01:58
For this, let us type ‘equals 0’ in the Criterion column, under CheckedIn.

02:06
And press Enter.

02:09
Let us now save the query and close the window.

02:13
In the main Base window, let us click on the Forms icon on the left panel.

02:20
And then click on the ‘Use Wizard to create Form’ option.

02:25
Now we see the familiar Form wizard.

02:28
Let us go through the 8 steps on the left to create our form.

02:34
In step 1. field selection, let us choose Table: Members.

02:40
Then let us move all the fields to the right side.

02:46
And let us click on the Next button.

02:49
We are in Step 2. Setup a subform.

02:54
So here, let us check the ‘Add subform’ check-box

02:59
and click on the option: ‘Subform based on manual selection of fields’.

03:07
Let us go to Step 3. Add subform fields.

03:11
Here we will call our new query which we designed a few minutes ago.

03:18
So, let us choose ‘Query: Books Not Returned’ from the Tables or Queries drop-down.

03:26
And we will move selected fields from the available list to the right side as shown on the screen. <pause>

03:37
Click on Next.

03:39
Step 4. Get joined fields.

03:43
Here we will choose the MemberId field from the top two drop-downs, as this is the only relating field.

03:53
And click on the Next button.

03:57
Step 5. Arrange Controls.

04:00
Here, we will choose the third option- Data sheet, for both the form and the subform.

04:08
And click on the Next button.

04:11
Step 6. Set data entry.

04:15
Here, we will leave the options as they are and click on Next.

04:22
Step 7. Apply Styles.

04:26
Let us choose Grey as the form background.

04:29
And go to the final step.

04:32
Step 8. Set Name.

04:36
Here, let us give a descriptive name to our form: ‘Members Who Need to Return Books’.

04:45
And let us click on the Modify form option, as we are going to do some more changes.

04:53
Now let's click on the Finish button.

04:56
In the Form Design window, notice that there are two tabular data sheet areas.

05:04
The one above is called the form and the one below is called the subform.

05:11
Now, let us add a label above the form.

05:15
We will click on the Label icon in the Form Controls toolbar at the top and draw it on the form.

05:25
Double clicking on the label, brings up its properties.

05:31
Here we will type ‘Members of the Library’ against label

05:37
and change the font style to Arial, Bold and Size 12. <pause>

05:47
Similarly, let us add a second label above the subform as shown on the screen

05:55
and call it ‘List of Books to be returned by the member’. <pause>

06:00
Next, let us shorten the form’s length as shown on the screen.

06:07
And then let us increase the length of the Name field in the form. <pause>

06:13
Similarly, let us lengthen the Book title field in the subform.
<pause>

06:21
Let us change the fonts here to Arial, Bold and Size 8.

06:28
And change the background color to white for the form and Blue 8 for the subform. <pause>

06:37
Next, let us hide the MemberId column by right-clicking on it and choosing the Hide column option.

06:47
Okay, we are done. So, let us save the form design and test it.

06:54
In the main Base window, let us open the ‘Members Who Need to Return Books’ form by double-clicking on it.

07:03
There is the form.

07:05
Let us browse through the members by either using the up or down arrow keys,

07:12
or by simply clicking on the various member names.

07:16
Notice that the subform below refreshes and shows books to be returned.

07:23
In the subform, let us choose any record

07:27
and let us type in ‘12/7/11’ in the actual return date field and check the CheckedIn field

07:41
and press Enter.

07:45
Let us now refresh the form by clicking on the Refresh icon in the Form Navigation toolbar at the bottom.

07:56
Notice that the record we just edited is no longer listed here

08:02
which means the book has been returned or checked-in.

08:07
So, there is our form with a subform.

08:11
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Subforms in LibreOffice Base.

08:17
To summarize, we learned how to:

08:20
create a Subform.
