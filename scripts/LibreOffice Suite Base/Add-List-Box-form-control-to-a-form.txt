Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Base.

00:06
In this tutorial, we will learn how to Add a List Box form control to a form.

00:14
In the last tutorial, we learnt how to modify a form using LibreOffice Base.

00:20
We also saw this image of the form that we started creating and modifying in the last tutorial.

00:34
And once we are done with our design, this is how our form will look like.

00:45
Notice here that we are seeing the first record in the Books Issued Table.

00:52
And, we are also seeing list boxes with real book titles and member names, instead of 'book Id's and 'member Id's.

01:01
Here are some push-buttons at the bottom for performing actions like saving a record, undoing the changes etc.

01:11
So, in this tutorial, we will learn how to add a List box form control to our form.

01:20
Let us first invoke the LibreOffice Base program, if it's not already open

01:32
and open our Library database.

01:35
If Base is already open then we can open the 'Library database' from here by clicking Open under the File menu

01:45
or by clicking the Recent Documents under the File menu.

01:50
Now we are in the 'Library database'.

01:54
Let us open 'Books Issued to Members' form that we created in the last tutorial.

02:01
To do this, let us click on the Forms icon on the left panel.

02:07
And right-click on the 'Books Issued to Members' form on the right panel and then click on edit.

02:17
We are now in the Form Design window.

02:21
Let us first consider the 'Book Title' label.

02:25
Notice that the text-box here, will only display 'BookId 'numbers which are not friendly on our eyes.

02:33
For us, book titles are friendlier.

02:37
And so, to display these titles, Base provides some ways and one of the ways is by using a List box form control.

02:48
Let us see how.

02:51
For this, let us first remove the text-box adjacent to the Book Title label.

02:59
We can do this by clicking on the text-box which selects it with the familiar set of green boxes

03:09
and then by right-clicking and clicking on Cut at the bottom.

03:16
There, we have removed the text-box.

03:20
Now, we will place a 'List box form control' here.

03:26
This can be accessed in the Form Controls toolbar.

03:31
We can bring it up by using the View menu and clicking on the Form Controls.

03:39
Notice that Base provides us a lot of 'form controls'; let us point our cursor over these icons to read the tool tips.

04:01
Let us find our list box icon.

04:04
There it is, let us click just once on this icon.

04:11
And let us move the mouse pointer into the form; notice that it has changed to a thin plus symbol.

04:21
Now we can draw the 'listbox form control' on our form.

04:26
For this, we will simply click, drag and drop it on our form.

04:34
Let us place it where we removed the text-box earlier.

04:39
Notice that a new wizard called 'List Box Wizard' has opened up over the Form design window.

04:48
Now, this wizard will help us connect the list box to the 'Book title' label.

04:56
Let us see how.

04:58
In this wizard, let us first choose the table from where we can get the book titles.

05:07
We will choose the Books table from the list and click on the Next button.

05:15
Now, in this window, we need to choose the field that will be displayed in the List box.

05:24
And we know that the Title field stores the book titles.

05:29
So, let us go to the next step.

05:32
This final window is where we will do the magic.

05:37
We will connect the related tables and fields.

05:41
Look at the field names. The 'Fields in the Value table' on the left are the fields in the 'Books Issued' table.

05:52
And the 'Fields in the list table' on the right are the fields in the 'Books' table.

05:59
We also know that 'book id' is the key field in the 'books table' and is represented in the 'Books Issued' table.

06:10
So, we will click on Book id on the left side list that says 'Field from the value table'.

06:19
Next, we will click on Book id on the right side list that says 'Field from the list table'.

06:29
Click on the Finish button to close this wizard.

06:34
There, we have connected the related tables and fields.

06:40
Now, Base will automatically display all the Book titles in this List box.

06:46
Let us now save the form

06:49
and close this window.

06:52
In the next part of the Base tutorial, we will continue adding the rest of the form controls to our form.

07:00
And this is how our form will look like, when we are done.

07:06
Here is an assignment.

07:08
Add a second list box for listing 'member names' instead of unfriendly 'member Ids'.

07:17
Do not worry about the placement of the list box now. Just draw it to the left of the Member name label.

07:27
We will relocate it appropriately across the 'Member Name' label in our next tutorial.

07:34
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on List Box Control in LibreOffice Base.

07:40
To summarize, we learned how to: Add a 'List Box form control' to a form.
