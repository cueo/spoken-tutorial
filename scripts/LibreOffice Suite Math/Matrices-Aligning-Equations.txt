Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Math.

00:04
In this tutorial, we will learn how to: * Write a matrix and

00:08
* Align equations on a particular character.

00:12
For this, let us first open our example Writer document that we created in our previous tutorials- "MathExample1.odt".

00:25
Notice all the previous example formulae which we wrote using Math.

00:30
Now, let us scroll to the last page of the document and press Control, Enter to go to a new page.

00:39
Let us call Math by clicking Insert menu, then Object and then Formula.

0049:
In mathematics, a matrix is a rectangular array of numbers or symbols which are called elements.

00:59
'Math' has separate mark up to represent a matrix and its rows and columns of elements.

01:08
I have the examples written already so as to save time. I will copy and paste them. Now, we’ll learn how to write a 2 by 3 matrix.

01:24
This matrix has 2 rows and 3 columns.

01:29
We will use the markup matrix and include all its elements within curly brackets, in the Formula Editor window.

01:40
Notice that the elements in a row are separated by one hash symbol

01:48
and the rows are separated by two hash symbols.

01:55
Use parentheses to enclose the matrix in brackets.

02:01
Now, notice that the brackets are short and do not cover all the elements in the matrix entirely.

02:12
They are of the same size as each element and hence are not scalable to the size of the matrix.

02:22
To solve this, we can use the words ‘Left’ and ‘Right’.

02:28
i.e. 'Left', just before open bracket and 'Right', before close bracket to make the brackets scalable.

02:41
Let me copy and paste the next example.

02:46
So, a 4 by 1 matrix will look like as shown on the screen.

02:52
Notice the scalable brackets in the Writer gray box.

02:57
The markup for the matrix is as shown on the screen.

03:03
Here, we can also use square brackets instead of parentheses.

03:09
So, using the matrix mark up, we can write matrices of any dimensions.

03:17
Now, let us write an example for matrix addition.

03:23
Let us go to a new line in the Formula Editor window.

03:28
We can press the Enter key twice to add two blank lines.

03:36
First, let us write two example 2 by 3 matrices, side by side, as shown on the screen.

03:46
Next, let us add a plus symbol in between these two matrices to denote addition.

03:54
To do this, we can simply click between the gap of these two matrices in the Writer Gray box.

04:03
Notice that the cursor in the Formula Editor Window is placed roughly between the two matrix mark ups here.

04:12
Type plus (+) in between these two matrices.

04:17
So, there is the plus symbol (+).

04:20
Next, let us add an equal to symbol (=) at the end with long gaps.

04:28
And then, the third matrix on the right, denoting the addition.

04:35
Notice that we have used Greek characters in our example.

04:42
So, there is the result of the addition of two matrices.

04:47
Let us save our work.

04:50
Next, let us see an example of multiplying a matrix by a number.

04:58
We will write a 2 by 3 matrix and multiply it by 4.

05:04
We will first write 4 times, followed by the matrix.

05:10
Let me copy the matrix and paste it in FEW.

05:17
Next, let us write the equal to (=) symbol at the end with long gaps

05:24
followed by the matrix product. I am copying and pasting the mark up for the matrix product.

05:33
So, there is the product of multiplying a 2 by 3 matrix by a number.

05:40
Now, we can format matrices by clicking on the Format menu and choosing the Fonts, Font Size, Alignment or the Spacing.

05:51
For example, let us choose Spacing.

05:55
In the Category drop-down, on the right, let us choose Matrices

06:02
and change the Line spacing to 20 percent and column spacing to 50 percent. Click OK.

06:17
Notice, how the matrices and their elements are well spaced out.

06:23
Let us save our work now by clicking on File and Save.

06:29
Now, we can also use matrices to write two or three equations and then align them on a particular character.

06:37
For example, we can write simultaneous equations and align them on the equal to character.

06:46
Let us write a set of simultaneous equations now, as shown on the screen.

06:52
Notice that they are not perfectly aligned on the equal to character.

06:58
So, here we can use the matrix mark-up to align them.

07:03
We can separate each part in the equation and treat the parts as elements of a matrix.

07:10
Here, '2x' is a part, 'y' is a part, equal to character is a part and so on.

07:20
Press Enter twice. Copy and paste the mark up.

07:26
And, thus the new mark up looks like as shown on the screen.

07:31
Here, we have used the matrix mark up, treated each part of the equation as an element and separated them by # (hash) symbols.

07:43
We have used the double hash symbols to separate the two equations.

07:50
So, there is a perfectly aligned set of equations.

07:56
Let us write another set of equations.

07:59
Here, let us suppose that we don’t have equal number of parts on the left and the right of the equal to character.

08:09
Notice the equations on the screen and they are not aligned on the equal to character.

08:16
Let us rewrite the mark up to align them. Press Enter twice. I am copying and pasting the markup.

08:25
So here, we have used alignr and alignl to align the parts to the right and the left of the equal to character.

08:36
And, there is our perfectly aligned set of equations.

08:41
Here is an assignment for you:

08:43
Write steps for multiplying a 2x3 matrix by a 3x1 matrix. Use formatting to change the font sizes and the spacing.

08:56
Write a set of three equations. Align the equations at the equal to (=) character.

09:04
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Matrix and Aligning equations in LibreOffice Math.

09:11
To summarize, we learned the following topics:

09:15
* Write a Matrix and * Align equations on a particular character.
