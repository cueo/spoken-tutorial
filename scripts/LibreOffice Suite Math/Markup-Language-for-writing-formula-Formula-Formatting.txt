Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Math.

00:04
In this tutorial, we will cover  the following topics:

00:08
 Mark up language for writing formula and formula formatting-
 Fonts
 Alignment and
 Spacing.


00:18
In the last tutorial, we introduced the mark up language for Math.

00:24
Now, let us learn more about Mark up language.

00:28
Let us first open a Writer document and then call the 'Math' application, inside Writer.

00:35
If Writer is already open then click on the Insert menu at the top and then click on Object and  choose Formula.

00:46
If Writer is not  open, we can invoke it from the Windows Start menu.

00:55
Using the Elements window is a very easy method of writing a formula.

01:01
But directly writing the mark-up language in the Formula Editor is a faster way of writing a formula.

01:10
Because, mark-up language for a formula resembles the way we would read the formula in English.

01:18
For example- to write 4 into 3,  we just need to type in the Formula Editor window "4 times 3".

01:28
Before we go to the next example, let us insert a blank line here.

01:36
Simply type the markup "newline" and notice that a new line is inserted in the Writer gray box area.

01:46
Let us type: "Some more example formulae: newline".

01:52
For readability, we will press the Enter key once

01:57
and write: x greater than equal to y.

02:03
Here, we will also number the formula.

02:07
So, we will type: 1. x greater than equal to y new line. Press Enter.

02:18
Notice, the Writer gray-box has refreshed and the contents are centered.

02:25
Next, let us write: a to the power of 10.

02:30
And the markup is: 2. a arrow pointing upward 10 new line and press Enter.

02:42
Notice the mathematical symbol in the Writer gray-box.

02:48
Now, let us write: square root of 16 = 4.

02:55
Type: 3. sqrt 16 within curly brackets equals 4 new line. Press Enter.

03:06
Notice this formula in the Writer gray-box.

03:10
Alright, now let us write a summation symbol for a suffix n, to denote a1 + a2 + a3 so on + an.

03:28
And the markup is: 4. sum a underscore n  new line. Press Enter.

03:37
Now, let us try an integral with a function. To write Integral f x dx, the markup is: 5. int f(x) dx newline

03:54
and notice the integral symbol in the Writer area.

04:00
Let us save our work now.  Go to File menu at the top, click on Save.

04:09
Name the document as "MathExample1".


04:15
Now, let us learn how to format the formulae we wrote .

04:21
Notice that they are all centered and don’t have a lot of space in between them.

04:28
We can use the Format menu at the top for making various format changes.

04:35
Let us first align all the formulae to the left.

04:40
For this, let us click on Format menu and choose Alignment.

04:46
In the new window, choose the Left option and click on the OK button.

04:54
Notice that the formulae are left aligned now.

04:58
We can change the font style by choosing Fonts under the Format menu.

05:06
Notice the various categories here.

05:10
We can set one type of font for variables, another type for functions, another for numbers and text.

05:23
To modify the font style, click on the Modify button and choose the category Variables.

05:34
Let us choose 'Arial Black' in the list-box and click on the OK button.

05:43
And let us save the font by clicking on the OK button here.

05:50
Now, notice the font changes in the Writer gray-box.

05:56
To increase the font size of the formulae, go to Format menu and click on Font Size .

06:06
Let us increase the Base size to ‘18 point’. Click on OK.

06:16
We can change the relative sizes of other categories such as the text or indexes or operators.

06:25
We can also use the Default button to undo all the font-size changes we made.

06:32
Notice, the font-size changes in the formulae.

06:37
Next, let us make changes to the spacing of the formulae.

06:42
Click on Format menu and choose Spacing.

06:48
Let us change the Spacing, Line spacing and Root spacing, each to 20 percent.

06:56
As we click on each spacing type, the image in the centre shows the location of the spacing type.

07:05
Again, we can choose spacing types from the various categories. To do this, let us click on the Category button.

07:16
Or, use the Default button to undo our changes.

07:22
Let us click on the OK button now.

07:25
And notice the spacing changes in the Writer gray-box.

07:30
More formatting is available in the Elements window.

07:35
Let us bring up the Elements window from the View menu.

07:40
Here, let us click on the last icon in the second row of Categories.

07:47
The tool tip here says ‘Formats’.

07:51
Here, we can choose placements of Subscripts and Superscripts, Alignments, Matrix, New Lines and Gaps.

08:03
Let us introduce a long gap in the fifth example, after the number 5. Click after 5.

08:13
Then from the Elements window, click on Formats > Long Gap.

08:20
The mark up for long gap is the ‘tilde’ character. And for the short gap, it is ‘Tiray’ character.

08:29
Notice the new gap after the number 5.

08:33
So, these are the ways we can format our formulae.

08:38
Feel free to explore all the formatting options which Math provides.

08:44
Okay, here is an assignment for you:

08:47
In the Writer window, write the following formulae using Mark up.

08:53
Use Elements window if necessary.

08:57
Summation of x to the power of 2.

09:02
Sin to the power of x plus cos to the power of x = 1 (use the Functions category in the Elements window).

09:15
Continued from the previous slide, write Summation from 1 to n of x.

09:23
(use the Operators category to set the limits for summation).

09:29
Change font to "Arial" and size to "18" point.

09:35
And provide more spacing between the symbols.

09:40
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Mark up Language and Formula Formatting in LibreOffice Math.

09:49
To summarize, we learned the following topics:

09:52
* Mark up language for writing formula and
 Formula formatting: Fonts, Alignment and Spacing.
