Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Math.

00:06
In this tutorial, we will cover introduction and Formula Editor of LibreOffice Math.

00:12
We will learn the following topics:

00:15
* What is LibreOffice Math?

00:18
* System requirements for using Math * Using the Formula Editor

00:23
* Writing a simple formula.

00:26
What is LibreOffice Math?

00:29
LibreOffice Math is a software application designed for creating and editing mathematical formulae.

00:38
It is bundled inside LibreOffice Suite and hence it is open source, free of cost and free to distribute.

00:47
The formulae and equations created using Math can stand alone

00:53
or it can be used in other documents in the LibreOffice Suite.

00:58
The formulae can be embedded into documents in Writer or Calc.

01:05
Some examples of formulae are fractions, integrals, equations and matrices.

01:13
Let us look at the System requirements for using Math.

01:17
For Windows, you will need Microsoft Windows 2000 (Service Pack 4 or higher), XP, Vista or Windows 7;

01:28
Pentium-compatible PC, 256 Mb RAM (512 Mb RAM recommended);

01:36
For Ubuntu Linux, the system requirements are: Linux kernel version 2.6.18 or higher; Pentium-compatible PC, 512Mb RAM recommended.

01:51
For complete information on System requirements, visit the LibreOffice website.

01:58
If you have already installed LibreOffice Suite then you will find Math in the LibreOffice Suite of programs.

02:06
If you have not installed LibreOffice Suite then you can download it from the official website:

02:14
In Linux, you can install it from the synaptic package manager.

02:18
I have installed LibreOffice version 3.3.3.

02:24
Okay, let us get started and open the 'Math' application.

02:28
In  Windows, go to the Start menu. Click on All  Programs >> LibreOffice Suite >> LibreOffice Math.

02:39
Or, we can call it from inside a LibreOffice Writer document.

02:46
Let us now click on LibreOffice Writer to open a new text document.

02:53
Now, in the Writer window, let us call Math.

02:57
Let us click on the Insert menu on the main menu bar and then Object which is toward the bottom and then click on Formula.

03:09
Now, we can see three areas in the Writer window.

03:14
The first is the Writer area on the top.

03:18
Here, notice the small gray box.

03:22
This is where the equations or the formulae we write, will appear in the mathematical form.

03:30
The second is the equation or the Formula Editor area at the bottom.

03:37
Here, we can type the mathematical formulae in a special markup language.

03:44
And the third is the Elements window that floats on the right.

03:50
If you don’t see the 'Elements' window, we can access it by clicking on the View menu and then choosing Elements.

04:01
This window provides us with a range of mathematical symbols and expressions.

04:08
If we click once outside the gray box in the Writer area, the Math windows disappear.

04:17
Double-click on the gray box to bring back the Math Formula Editor and the Elements window. Ok.. let us now write a simple multiplication  formula: 4 multiplied by 3 is equal to 12.

04:37
Now the Elements window has categories of symbols on the top and symbols at the bottom.

04:46
Let us click once on the top left icon. The tool tip, here, says Unary or Binary Operators.

04:57
And at the bottom, we see some basic mathematical operators such as plus, minus, multiplication and division.

05:08
Let us click on a into b in the second row, denoting multiplication.

05:17
Now, notice the Formula editor window.

05:20
It shows two place holders separated by the word "times".

05:27
Also, in the Writer gray box area at the top, notice two squares separated by the multiplication symbol.

05:37
Let us highlight the first placeholder in the Formula editor by double-clicking it and then typing 4.

05:46
Next, let us highlight the second place holder and type 3 in the Formula editor window.

05:54
Notice that the Writer gray box has refreshed automatically and it displays 4 into 3.

06:03
We can also click on the View menu at the top and choose Update.

06:10
Or, we can use the keyboard shortcut F9 to refresh the window.

06:16
Next, let us complete the formula and add is equal to 12 to it.

06:24
For this, let us click on the second icon that says Relations, in the Categories section, in the Elements window.

06:35
Notice the various relation elements here.

06:38
Let us select the first one: a is equal to b.

06:44
And we will delete the first place holder and type 12 in the second place holder.

06:53
And, there is our first simple formula in the Writer area: 4 times 3 is equal to 12.

07:02
Now we learnt how to use the Elements window to write a formula in a very easy way.

07:09
We can also write a formula by right-clicking on the 'Formula Editor' window and selecting symbols here.

07:19
The context menu displays the same categories of symbols as in the Elements window.

07:26
Choosing any category, displays the available symbols in that category.

07:33
There is a third way of writing a formula.

07:37
We can directly write the formula in the Formula Editor window.

07:42
Here, we will use a special mark-up-language that the 'Math' application can understand.

07:50
We already saw one simple example of the mark up language.

07:56
4 times 3 equals 12.

07:59
Notice the word ‘times’ here.

08:03
Similarly, to write 4 divided by 4 equals 1, the mark up is : 4 over 4 equals 1.

08:15
Now that we are done, here is an assignment for you:

08:20
In the Writer window, write the following formulae.

08:24
4 divided by 4 = 1.

08:29
Use ‘newline’ mark up to enter a blank line in between your formulae.

08:36
a Boolean AND b

08:40
4 is greater than 3

08:43
x is approximately equal to y

08:47
And 4 is not equal to 3.

08:51
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on LibreOffice Math- Introduction and Formula Editor.

08:59
To summarize, we learned the following topics:

09:03
* What is LibreOffice Math?

09:06
* System requirements and prerequisites for using Math

09:10
* Using the Formula Editor

09:12
* Writing a simple formula.
