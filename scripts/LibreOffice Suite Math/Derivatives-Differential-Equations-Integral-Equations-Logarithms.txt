Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Math.

00:05
In this tutorial, we will learn how to write:
 Derivatives and Differential equations
 Integral equations and 
 Formulae with Logarithms.


00:17
For this, let us first open our example Writer document that we created in our previous tutorials- "MathExample1.odt".

00:29
Here, let us scroll to the last page of the document and press Control, Enter to go to a new page.

00:37
Now, type: “Derivatives and Differential Equations: ” and press the Enter key twice.

00:45
Now, let us call Math by clicking Insert menu, then Object and then Formula.

00:54
Before we go ahead, let us increase the font-size to 18 point.

01:00
Change the Alignment to the Left

01:03
and add newlines and blank lines in between each of our examples for better readability.

01:11
Let us now learn how to write derivatives and differential equations.

01:19
Math provides a very easy way of writing these formulae or equations.

01:25
We just have to treat them like a fraction and use the mark up over.

01:33
For example- to write a total derivative, df by dx, the mark up is "df over dx" in the Formula Editor Window.

01:50
Next, for a partial derivative, we can use the word ‘partial’ and the markup looks like: del f over del x.

02:02
We have to use the curly brackets when we use the mark-up ‘partial’.

02:08
Notice the 'del' symbol for partial derivatives in the Writer gray box.

02:14
Here is another example: Newton's second law of motion

02:21
which describes the relationship between acceleration and force

02:26
F is equal to m a.

02:30
This can be written as an ordinary differential equation as: F of t is equal to m into d squared x over d t squared.

02:45
Notice that we have used various sets of curly brackets to state the order of operation

02:56
and the equation looks like as shown on the screen.

03:01
Here is another example of a differential equation.

03:05
Newton’s law of cooling.

03:08
If theta of t is the temperature of an object at time t, then we can write a differential equation:

03:18
d of theta over d of t  is equal to minus k into theta minus S

03:30
where 'S' is the temperature of the surrounding environment.

03:35
Notice the equation in the Writer gray box.

03:39
Let us save our work now. Go to File and click on Save.

03:45
Now, let us see how to write Integral equations.

03:50
And let us go to a new page by clicking three times slowly, outside the Writer gray box

03:58
and then press Control, Enter.

04:03
Type: “Integral Equations: ”

04:06
and press Enter twice.

04:11
Now, let us call Math from the Insert > Object menu;

04:17
increase the Font size to 18 point

04:22
and change the Alignment to the Left.

04:25
To write an integral symbol, we just need to use the mark-up “int” in the Formula Editor Window.

04:35
So, given a function 'f' of a real variable 'x' and an interval 'a, b' of the real line on the x-axis, the definite integral is written as Integral from a to b f of x dx.

04:58
We have used the mark-up ‘int’ to denote the integral symbol.

05:04
To specify the limits- 'a' and 'b', we have used the mark-up ‘from’ and ‘to’.

05:13
Notice the formula in the Writer gray box.

05:17
Next, let us write an example double integral formula to calculate the volume of a cuboid.

05:26
And the formula is as shown on the screen.

05:30
As we can see, the mark-up for a double integral is ‘i i n t’. Simple..

05:38
Similarly, we can also use a triple integral to find the volume of a cuboid.

05:46
And the mark up for a triple integral is ‘i i i n t’.

05:52
We can also use the subscript mark up to specify Limits of an integral.

06:00
Using the subscript, Math places the character to the bottom right of the integral.

06:06
So, these are the ways we can write integral formulae and equations in Math.

06:13
Now, let us see how to write formulae containing logarithms.

06:19
Let us write these in a fresh Math gray box or Math object.

06:24
Type "Logarithms: " and press Enter twice.

06:29
Call Math again;

06:35
and change the Font to 18 point

06:39
and align them to the Left.

06:42
A simple formula using logarithm is log 1000 to the base 10 is equal to 3.

06:52
Notice the mark up here.

06:55
Here is another example: log 64 to the base 2 is equal to 6.

07:03
Let us now write the integral representation of the natural logarithm.

07:10
The natural logarithm of t is equal to the integral of 1 by x dx from 1 to t.

07:20
And the mark up looks like as shown on the screen.

07:25
Let us save our examples.

07:29
Here is an assignment for you:

07:31
Write the following derivative formula:

07:35
d squared y by d x squared is equal to d by dx of ( dy by dx).

07:47
Use scalable brackets.

07:51
Write the following integral:

07:53
Integral with limits 0 to 1 of {square root of x } dx.

08:04
Next, write a double integral as follows:

08:09
Double integral from T of { 2 Sin x – 3 y cubed + 5 } dx dy.

08:23
And using the formula:

08:25
log x to the power of p to the base b is equal to p into log x to the base b

08:35
solve log 1024 to the base 2.

08:41
Format your formulae.

08:43
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on writing Differential and Integral equations and logarithms in LibreOffice Math.

08:52
To summarize, we learned how to write:* Derivatives and Differential equations

08:58
* Integral equations and *Formulae with Logarithms.
