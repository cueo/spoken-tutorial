Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Math.

00:04
In this tutorial, we will cover the following topics:

00:08
* Using Greek characters like alpha, beta, theta and pi.

00:15
* Using Brackets. * Writing steps to solve a quadratic equation.

00:21
Let us learn how to write Greek characters using Math.

00:26
For this, let us first open the example Writer document that we created in the last tutorial i.e. "MathExample1.odt".

00:41
Double-click on the Gray-box that has the formulae we wrote.

00:47
This brings up the Math Formula Editor and the Elements window.

00:54
Let us click on the Formula Editor border and drag and drop to the right to make it float.

01:02
This maximizes the Writer window for better visibility.

01:07
Now, Greek characters- for example: alpha, beta, theta and pi are common in mathematical formulae.

01:16
But, we won’t find these characters in the Elements window.

01:21
We can write them directly by using the percentage sign followed by the name of the character in English.

01:30
For example- to write pi, we simply type "%pi" in the Formula Editor.

01:40
To write a lowercase character, type the name of the character in lowercase.

01:47
For example- to write alpha in lower case, type "%alpha" or "%beta".

01:59
To write an uppercase character, type the name of the character in uppercase.

02:06
For example- to write gamma in upper case, type "%GAMMA" or "%THETA".

02:17
Another way to enter Greek characters is by using the Catalog from the Tools menu.

02:26
Under the Symbol set, select Greek

02:31
and double-click on a Greek letter from the list.

02:35
Notice the mark up for the Greek letter as alpha which is displayed below the list.

02:43
So, this is how we can introduce Greek characters in a formula.

02:49
Explore the Symbols Catalog to know the mark up for other Greek characters.

02:56
Let us now learn how to use Brackets in our formulae.

03:02
'Math' does not know about order of operation in a formula.

03:07
So, we have to use brackets to state the order of operation.

03:13
For example, how do we write: First add x and y, then divide 5 by the result?

03:22
We can type: "5 over x + y".

03:28
Now, is this really what we wanted to write?

03:32
No. We want to add x and y first and we can do this by introducing curly brackets around x and y.

03:44
And the mark up looks like: 5 over x+y in curly brackets.

03:52
So, using brackets can help set the order of operation in a formula.

03:58
Let us save our work by using the File menu at the top and choosing Save.

04:08
Let us now write the steps to solve a quadratic equation.

04:13
We will go to new page in the Writer document by pressing Control + Enter.

04:21
Let us type: "Solving a Quadratic Equation"

04:25
and call Math from the Insert > Object > Formula menu.

04:33
I have already typed the quadratic equations. I will cut and paste them so as to save time.

04:42
So, here is the quadratic equation we will solve: x squared - 7 x + 3 = 0

04:53
To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula shown on the screen.

04:59
Here, ‘a’ is the coefficient of the 'x' squared term, ‘b’ is the coefficient of the 'x' term and ‘c’ is the constant.

05:11
And we can solve the equation by substituting 1 for a, -7 for b, and 3 for c, in the formula.

05:23
So, first let us write the mark up for the quadratic equation that we want to solve.

05:30
First, we will call Math from the Insert > Object > Formula menu.

05:39
In the Format Editor window, let us type the mark up as follows:

05:46
x squared minus 7 x plus 3 = 0.

05:53
Let us write two newlines for entering blank lines for better readability.

06:01
Press Enter  and type: "Quadratic Formula:". Press Enter.

06:07
It is always a good practice to break down a complex formula by starting with the inner most elements of the formula, first.

06:16
And then we can work our way around these elements.

06:21
So, we will first write the inner most square root function.

06:27
And the mark up is square root of b squared - 4ac in curly brackets.

06:37
Next, we will add the minus b plus or minus to the above expression and put them inside curly brackets.

06:48
We will make the above expression a numerator by adding another set of curly brackets

06:57
and add ‘over 2a’ to the expression.

07:02
And, finally add x equals to the beginning

07:08
with two long gaps surrounding the equal to symbol.

07:13
And, there is the quadratic formula.

07:16
This is how we can break down complex formulae and build them part by part.

07:22
Next, let us type the rest of the text as follows in the Formula Editor window

07:29
Where ‘a’ is the coefficient of the 'x' squared term, 'b' is the coefficient of the 'x' term, 'c' is the constant followed by a newline.

07:43
And type: "We can solve the equation by substituting 1 for a, -7 for b, 3 for c’ followed by two newlines.

07:59
So, the mark up after the substitution is as shown on the screen.

08:05
So, we have substituted the numbers using parentheses in the equation.

08:12
Okay, here is an assignment for you:

08:15
Complete the remaining steps for solving the  quadratic equation.

08:20
Display the two results separately.

08:23
Format the steps by changing alignments and spacing.

08:28
Add long gaps and newlines wherever necessary.

08:33
Write the following formula:  pi is similar or equal to 3.14159.

08:43
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Greek Characters, Brackets and Equations in LibreOffice Math.

08:52
To summarize, we learned the following topics:

08:56
* Using Greek characters like alpha, beta, theta and pi.

09:01
* Using Brackets * Writing steps to solve a Quadratic Equation.
