Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Math.

00:04
In this tutorial, we will learn how to:

00:07
* Write Set operations

00:10
* Write Factorials and

00:12
* Cross reference equations by numbering.

00:16
For this, let us first open our example 'Writer' document that we created in our previous tutorials "MathExample1.odt".

00:29
Here, let us go to the end of the document and press Control, Enter to go to a new page.

00:37
And type “Set Operations: ” and press  Enter twice.

00:42
Now, let us call Math.

00:45
Before we go ahead, let us increase the Font-size to 18 point.

00:51
Change the Alignment to the Left.

00:54
Let us now learn how to write Set operations.

01:00
Math has separate mark up to represent Sets which are collections of distinct elements.

01:07
Let us write four (4) example sets, in the Formula Editor window, as shown on the screen:

01:14
Set A with 5 elements,

01:18
 Set B,

01:19
 Set C,

01:21
and Set D with elements each.

01:26
Notice that to write the brackets for sets, we can use the mark up: lbrace and rbrace.

01:35
Now, we can write set operations such as unions and intersections.

01:42
First, let us write a union operation.

01:46
The mark-up for B union C is the same as we read it;

01:51
and the resulting set is 1, 2, 6, 4 and 5 which includes all the distinct elements in both sets.

02:04
The markup for an intersection operation is again the same as we read it.

02:10
The intersection includes only the common elements from both the sets.

02:16
So, the result of B intersection D is 6.

02:23
And we can also write: set C is a subset of set A, as every element in 'C' is in set A.

02:35
The mark up for this is C subset A.

02:42
You can learn to write more set operations by exploring the Elements window, by clicking on the third icon there.

02:51
Go to View > Elements > Set Operations.

02:59
Let us save our work now.

03:02
Click on File > Save.

03:06
Now, let us write Factorial functions.

03:11
We will designate numbers 1 to 3 for the three formulae we are going to write shortly.

03:19
These will help to cross reference them anywhere within the Writer document.

03:25
Let us go to a new page by clicking three times slowly, outside the Writer gray box.

03:33
Press Control, Enter.

03:36
Type: “Factorial Function: ” and press Enter twice.

03:42
Now, we know how to call Math.

03:45
But, there is another way to bring up the Math object into the Writer.

03:51
For this, simply write ‘f n’ on the Writer document and press F3.

03:59
We are now seeing a new Math object that says E is equal to m c squared

04:07
and along with that the number one (1), within parentheses, on the right.

04:14
Meaning- we can cross reference this formula with the number 1, anywhere in this document.

04:22
We will learn the details of how to do this later.

04:27
For now, let us double-click on the Math object.

04:32
And do the formatting. Font size 18 and 'Left' Alignment.

04:40
Okay, let us now write an example for Factorial.

04:44
The mark up ‘fact’ represents the factorial symbol.

04:50
So, let us overwrite the existing formula with ours:

04:55
5 Factorial = 5 into 4 into 3 into 2 into 1 = 120.

05:07
Notice the mark up here.

05:09
Let us write our next formula in a new Math object here.

05:14
For this, let us first click outside this Writer gray box three times slowly.

05:23
Press the down-arrow key two or three times to go to the end of this page.

05:30
And type ‘f n’ and press F3 to bring up the second Math object.

05:37
Again, we will repeat the formatting

05:46
and overwrite the existing formula with the factorial definition:

05:52
n factorial is equal to prod from k = 1 to n of k.

06:01
Notice the mark-up ‘prod’ which denotes product, similar to sigma for summation.

06:10
Now, let us introduce a third Math object just like the first two

06:20
and rewrite the factorial definition as two conditional formulae, as shown on the screen.

06:30
Notice the mark up ‘binom’ which displays a vertical stack of two elements and helps with better alignment.

06:42
Let us now see how we can cross reference these formulae.

06:47
For this, let us go to a new page

06:51
and type: "An example of factorial is provided here:"

06:59
Now, let us click on the Insert menu and on Cross reference.

07:06
In the new pop-up, let us select Text in the Type list.

07:12
Then choose the first item in the Selection list denoting the first factorial formula we wrote.

07.21
Now choose Reference in the ‘Insert reference to’ list and click on Insert once and close.

07.31
So, the number one (1) in parentheses has appeared next to our text. And we are done.

07.39
Let us test it by simply clicking on this number

07.43
and notice that the cursor has jumped to the location where we wrote the first formula.

07.51
So, this is how we can cross reference Math formulae anywhere within the Writer document.

07.58
Let us save our work.

08.01
Here are some reference links for Math:

08:06
Download Guide at 'libreoffice.org documentation' link.

08:14
You can also visit the following website for more information on Math.

08:20
And finally, here is an assignment for you. Use the Writer document.

08:25
Using the example Sets in this tutorial: check if A union ( B union C) is equal to (A union B) union C.

08:40
Write the results of A minus B

08:43
and cross reference the second and third factorial formulae in the Writer document.

08:51
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on Sets, Factorials and Cross Referencing in LibreOffice Math.

08:59
To summarize, we learned how to:

09:03
* Write Set operations

09:05
* Write Factorials and

09:08
* Cross reference equations by numbering.
