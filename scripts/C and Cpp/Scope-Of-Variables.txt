 Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Scope of variables in C and C++.

 00:08
In this tutorial we will learn,

 00:11
* What is the Scope of variable?

 00:13
* What is a Global variable?

 00:16
* What is a Local variable?

 00:19
Few  examples.

 00:22
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.

00:27
 To record this tutorial, I am using

 00:30
Ubuntu Operating System version 11.04, gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1.

  00:41
 Let us start with the introduction to the scope of variables.

 00:47
It is the region of code within which the variable can be accessed.

 00:54
Depending on it's type and place of declaration it is divided into two categories:

 00:59
Global Variable &

 01:02
Local Variable.

01:05
 Now we will see an example.

 01:07
I have already typed the program on the editor.

 01:10
Let me open it.

 01:14
Note that our file name is scope.c.

 01:19
Let me explain the code now.

 01:23
This is our header file.

01:26
Here we have declared two global variables a and b.

 01:32
And we have initialized them by assigning values as 5 and 2.

 01:39
A global variable is available to all functions in your program.

 01:44
These are declared outside any functions, above main() function.

 01:51
These have a global scope.

 01:53
Here we have declared a function add without arguments.

01:59
Here 'sum' is  a local variable, it is declared inside the function add.

 02:07
A local variable is available only to the function inside which it is declared.

 02:13
These variables are declared inside a block.

 02:16
These have local scope.

 02:19
Then sum of a & b will be stored in the variable 'sum'. Here we print the sum.

 02:29
 This is our main() function.

 02:33
 The add function is called and then executed.

 02:38
 And this is our return statement.

02:40
 Now click on Save.

 02:43
 Let us execute the program.

 02:45
 Please open the terminal window  by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

 02:55
 To compile, type

 02:56
gcc space scope.c space hyphen o space sco and press Enter.

 03:05
To execute,

 03:06
type ./sco (dot slash sco), press Enter.

 03:10
  The output is displayed as

 03:13
Sum of a and b is 7.

 03:16
 Now let us see how to execute the same program in C++.

  03:20
 Come back to our program. First press Shift, Ctrl & S keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

 03:31
Now save the file with an extension .cpp  (dot cpp) and click on Save.

  03:41
 Let us change the header file as iostream.

 03:47
 Now  include the using statement. Click on save .

 03:58
 The  declaration of global variable and local variable is same in  C++.

 04:03
So, no need to change anything.

  04:07
 Now replace the printf statement with the cout statement.

  04:13
 Delete the format specifier and '\n'.

 04:17
Now delete the comma.

  04:19
 Type two opening angle brackets.

 04:22
Delete the closing bracket, again type two opening angle brackets.

 04:26
And within the double quotes type backslash n. Now click on Save.

 04:35
Let us execute the program.

 04:39
Come back to our terminal.

 04:42
 To compile, type g++ space scope dot cpp space -o space sco1 

 04:52
 Here we have sco1 because we don't want to overwrite output parameter sco for the file 'scope.c'.

 05:04
 Now press Enter.

 05:07
 To execute type ./sco1 and press Enter.

05:14
The output is displayed as  Sum of a and b is 7.

  05:19
 We can see  that it is similar to our C code.

  05:27
Now we will see some common errors which we can come across.

 05:31
Come back to our program. Suppose here I will declare a  variable a again.

 05:41
Type int a  and a semicolon.

  05:45
 Click on Save. We have declared  the variable 'a' above the main() function and after the add function.

  05:55
 Let us see what happens.

 05:57
Come back to our  terminal.

06:01
 Now compile as before.

06:05
We see errors, redefinition of 'int a'  ,  'int a' previously defined here. Come back to our program.

06:18
a is a global variable.

06:20
It has a global scope.

06:22
We cannot declare the variable twice as it is already declared globally.

06:27
We can only declare variable a as a local variable .

06:34
Let us fix the error.

  06:36
 Delete this .

  06:39
 Click on Save.

  06:41
 Let us execute again.

06:42
Come back to our terminal.

  06:45
  Now  compile as before, execute as before.

 06:49
  Yes, it is working.

06:52
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

  06:56
 Let us summarize.

  06:58
 In this tutorial we learnt ,

  07:00
 Scope of variable,

  07:02
 Global variable, e.gÂ : int a=5 &

  07:07
 and  local variable ,e.g:int sum

  07:12
  As an assignment,

07:14
write a program to print the difference of two numbers.
