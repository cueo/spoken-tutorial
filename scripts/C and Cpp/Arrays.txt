Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Arrays in C and C++.

 00:07
In this tutorial we will learn:

 00:09
* What is an array

 00:11
* Declaration of an array 

 00:13
* Initialization of an array 

 00:16
* Few Examples on array.

 00:18
We will also see some common errors and their solutions.

 00:22
 To record this tutorial, I am using

 00:25
Ubuntu Operating System version 11.04,

00:30
 gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 .

00:36
Let us start with the introduction to Array.

00:39
Array is the collection of data or elements of same data-type.

 00:44
Array index starts from 0.

 00:48
The first element is stored at index 0.

 00:52
There are three types of arrays:

 00:55
Single dimensional array 

 00:57
Two dimensional array and

00:59
Multi-dimensional array. 

 01:01
We will be discussing single dimensional array in this tutorial.

 01:06
Let us see how to declare single dimensional array.

 01:09
The Syntax for this is:

 01:11
data-type name of the array and size

01:16
example, here we have declared an integer array 'star' which contains 5 elements.

01:24
The array index will start from star 0 to star 4.

01:29
We saw the declaration of an array.

01:32
Now, we will see the initialization of an array.

 01:35
The Syntax for this is:

 01:38
data-type,( name of the array ), size is equal to elements

 01:44
example: here we have declared an 'integer array star' with size 3. The elements of the array are 1,2 and 3.

01:54
Here the index will start from star 0 to star 2.

01:59
Now, lets us move to the examples.

02:01
I have already typed the program on the editor.

02:04
So, let me open it.

 02:06
Please note that our file name is array.c 

 02:10
 In this program, we will calculate the sum of the elements stored in an array.

 02:16
 Let me explain the code now.

 02:18
 This is our header file.

02:20
This is our main() function.

 02:22
 Here, we have declared and initialized an array star with size 3.

 02:28
 The elements of the array are 4, 5 and 6.

 02:33
Then we have declared an 'integer variable' sum.

 02:36
 Here we add the elements of the array and store the result in sum.

 02:41
Note that 4 will be stored at index 0, 5 will be stored at index 1 and 6 will be stored at index 2.

 02:50
 Then we print the sum.

 02:52
This is our return statement.

 02:54
Now, click on Save.

 02:57
 Let us execute the program.

 02:59
Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T  keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

 03:09
To compile, type gcc space array dot c space hypen o array and press Enter.

 03:19
 To execute, type dot slash array (./array). Press Enter.

 03:24
 Here the output is displayed as,

 03:26
The sum is 15.

 03:28
Now let us see some common errors which we can come across.

 03:32
Come back to our program.

 03:34
Suppose, here at line number 4, we miss the curly brackets.

 03:39
Click on Save. Let us see what happens.

 03:42
Come back to the terminal.

 03:44
Let us compile as before.

 03:47
 We see an error:

 03:49
Invalid initializer and Expected identifier or bracket before numeric constant.

 03:56
This is because arrays must be initialized within curly brackets.

 04:01
Come back to our program. Let us fix the error.

 04:04
Type the curly brackets here at line number 4.

 04:09
Now, click on Save.

 04:12
Lets us execute. Come back to the terminal.

 04:15
Let us compile as before. Let us execute as before.

 04:19
 Yes, it is working.

 04:21
Now we will execute the same program in C++.

 04:25
Come back to our program.

 04:28
I will change a few things here.

 04:30
First, press Shift , Ctrl and S keys  simultaneously on your keyboard.

 04:38
Now save the file with the extension dot cpp (.cpp) and click on Save.

 04:44
Let us change the  header file as iostream.

 04:49
Now include the using statement.

 04:55
The declaration and initialization of an array is same in C++.

 05:01
Hence no need to change anything here.

 05:04
Now replace the printf statement with the cout statement.

 05:09
Delete the format specifier and backslash n (\n), now delete the comma and type two opening angle brackets.

 05:17
Delete the bracket here. Again type two opening angle brackets and within the double quotes type backslash n (\n).

 05:26
Now, click on Save.

 05:29
Let us execute. Come back to a terminal.

 05:32
To compile, type g++ space array dot cpp space hyphen o space array1

 05:42
Here we have array1 because we don't want to overwrite the output parameter array for the file array dot c.

 05:51
Now press Enter.

 05:54
To execute type, dot slash array1(./array1) . Press Enter.

 05:59
The output is displayed as: The sum is 15

 06:02
We can see that it is similar to our C code.

 06:07
Now, we will see another common error.

 06:10
Come back to our program.

 06:12
Suppose here, at line number 7,

 06:14
I will type star[1],  star[2] and  star[3];

 06:23
click on Save.

 06:24
Let us execute. Come back to our terminal.

 06:28
Let me clear the prompt.

 06:30
Let us compile as before.

 06:33
Let us execute as before.

 06:36
We get an unexpected output.

 06:39
This is because array index starts from 0.

 06:43
Come back to our program. We can see here the array index starts from one.

 06:49
Hence it is giving an error. Let us fix the error.

 06:54
Type 0 here 1 and 2. Click on Save.

 07:02
Let us execute. Come back to our terminal.

 07:05
Let us compile as before. Execute as before.

 07:09
Yes, it is working.

 07:12
Now, we will go back to our slides.

 07:14
Le us summarize.

 07:16
In this tutorial we learned:

 07:19
* Arrays

 07:20
* To declare Single Dimensional Arrays

 07:23
* To initialize Single Dimensional Arrays

 07:26
example int star[3]={4, 5, 6}

 07:31
To add the elements of the array, example sum is equal to star 0 plus star 1 plus star 2.

 07:40
As an assignment,

 07:41
write a program to calculate the difference of the elements stored in an array.
