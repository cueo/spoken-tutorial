  Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Nested if and Switch statements in C and C++.

 00:07
   In this tutorial we will learn,

  00:09
 how to use nested if statement and

  00:12
 switch statement.

  00:13
 We will do this with the help of some examples.

   00:17
  To record this tutorial, I am using

  00:20
 Ubuntu operating system version 11.10,

  00:24
 gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu.

 00:30
  First we will learn how to write nested if and switch statements with an example.

  00:36
 I have already written the program.

 00:39
  Let’s have a look.

  00:40
  In this program we will learn to check the range of integers.

   00:45
  Note that our file name is nested-if.c.

   00:50
  Let me explain the code now.

  00:52
  This is our Header file.

  00:54
  This is our  main() function.

  00:56
 Inside the main() function we have declared two integer variables 'x and y'.

   01:02
Here we prompt the users to enter a number between the range of 0 to 39.

 01:08
  We take the value of y as input from the user.

  01:12
 This is our if condition.

   01:14
 Here, we will check whether y/10=0.

  01:19
 If the condition is true,

  01:20
 we print "you have entered the number in the range of 0-9".

 01:25
 This is our else-if condition.

  01:28
  Here we check that y/10 equals to 1.

  01:32
If the condition is true,

  01:34
 we print  "you have entered a number in the range of 10-19".

   01:39
In this else if condition we check whether the number is in the range of 20-29.

  01:45
 And here we will see that the number is in the range of 30 to 39.

  01:51
  This is our else condition.

  01:53
  If all of the above conditions are false,

  01:55
 we print "number not in range".

  01:58
 And this is our return statement.

  02:01
  Now let us execute the program.

  02:03
 Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl+Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

 02:12
To execute, type gcc space nested-if.c space hyphen o space nested. Press Enter.

 02:23
 Type dot slash “nested” (./nested). Press Enter.

  02:28
 We see Enter a number between 0 to 39.

 02:32
 I will enter 12.

 02:34
 The output is displayed as:

  02:35
 you have entered the  number  in the range of 10-19.

  02:40
 Let us enter another number.

  02:42
   Let's execute again. Press the up arrow key, press Enter.

  02:48
 I will give  5 this time.

   02:50
 We see the output as :

  02:52
 you have entered the number in the range of 0-9.

  02:56
  The conditional execution can also be done in another way.

  03:00
 By using switch statement.

  03:02
 Let’s see how it is done.

 03:05
 We will see  the same program using switch.

  03:08
 I have already opened the program.

  03:10
  Let's switch back to our text editor.

  03:13
I have explained this in the previous program.

 03:16
So I will move on to the switch statements.

 03:20
Here, we divide the inputs i.e y  by 10 and the result  is  stored in  the variable x.

03:28
 That means the quotient will be stored in x.

  03:32
 With the help of the quotient we can identify the range of the number.

  03:36
  Here, we tell the switch command that the variable to be checked is x.

  03:41
This is case 0 . If case 0 is satisfied

  03:45
 then we print you have entered  the number in the range of 0-9.

 03:51
 We add break to come out of the loop if the case is satisfied.

  03:55
 We need to break the loop each time.

  03:58
 It is because only one condition can be true at a time.

 04:03
This is “case 1”. “case 1” means “if the value of x is 1”.

  04:08
 We print you have entered a number in the range of 10-19.

   04:12
 This is   “case 2” .

  04:14
Here  we print you have entered a number in the range of 20-29.

 04:20
 And this is case 3. Here we check whether the number is in the range of 30-39.

 04:26
 This is the default case. Default case specifies what needs to be done if none of the above cases are satisfied.

  04:36
 Here we print "number not in range".

  04:39
 And This is our return statement.

  04:41
 Let us execute the program.

  04:43
Switch back to the terminal.

  04:46
Type gcc space switch.c space -o space switch. Press Enter.

 04:55
 Type ./switch(dot slash switch). Press Enter.

  05:00
 Enter a number between 0 to  39. I will enter 35.

  05:06
  The output is displayed as “you have entered the number in the range of 30 to 39”.

  05:10
 Now we will see how to execute the programs  in C++.

 05:16
Switch back to the text editor.

  05:18
 Note that our file name is nested-if.cpp.

  05:23
 Here the logic and implementation are same.

  05:27
  There are a few changes like:

  05:30
The header file as "iostream" in place of "stdio.h".

  05:35
Here we have included the using statement

  05:39
Using namespace std.

  05:41
And the  cout and cin function in place of printf and scanf.

  05:46
You can see that the rest of the code is similar to our C program.

  05:51
Let’s execute the code.

  05:53
Come back to the terminal.

  05:56
Type g++ space nested-if.cpp space -o space nested1. Press Enter.

  06:07
Type ./nested1. Press Enter.

  06:11
 Enter a number between 0 to 39. I will enter 40.

  06:16
 The output is displayed as: “number not in range”

  06:20
Now let’s see the switch program in C++.

  06:24
 Come back to our text editor.

  06:27
 Here also the logic and implementation are same.

  06:31
 You can see that the  header file is iostream.

  06:34
 Here is the using statement.

  06:37
 And we have changed the cout and cin function.

  06:41
 Rest of the code is similar to our switch.c program.

  06:45
 Let us execute.

  06:46
Come back to our terminal.

  06:48
Type g++ space switch.cpp space -o space switch1. Press Enter.

  06:58
 Type ./switch1. Press Enter.

  07:02
 Enter a number between 0 to 39.

  07:05
  I will enter 25.

  07:09
  The output is displayed as:

  07:11
  “you have entered  the number in the range of 20-29”

  07:15
  Now let us switch back to our slides.

 07:18
We will see the comparison between switch and nested-if statements.

  07:23
  Switch statement is evaluated according to the result of the expression.

  07:28
Netsed-if statement is run only if the result of the expression is true.

  07:34
In switch, we treat various values of the variable as cases.

  07:39
In nested-if we have to write the conditional statement for each value of the variable.

  07:45
  Switch statement can only check the integer values.

  07:50
  Nested if can check for both, integer and fractional values.

  07:55
  This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

 07:58
Let us summarize.

 08:00
  In this tutorial, we learnt * 'nested if' statement. e.g. else if( y/10 equals to 0)

  08:08
 * switch statement. e.g. switch(x) and

  08:12
* Difference between nested-if and switch statements.
