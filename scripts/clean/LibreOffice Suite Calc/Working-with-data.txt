Welcome Spoken tutorial LibreOffice Calc – Working data. In tutorial, learn about: Speed using Fill tools Selection lists. Sharing content sheets. Removing data, replacing data changing part data. Here using:Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 andLibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4. Entering data spreadsheet labor-intensive Calc provides several tools making considerably easier. The basic ability drag drop contents one cell another mouse. But Calc also includes several tools automating input, especially repetitive material. These tools namely- Fill tool, Selection lists. These input information multiple sheets document. We learn one one one. Let us open “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” file. The Fill tool useful method duplicating contents sheet. In “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” file, let's say- want copy data heading Cost adjacent cells. Then, first select data needs copied clicking cell contains entry “6000”. Now, holding left mouse button, drag mouse till end cell contains cost entry “2000”. Also, select cells want copy data. Now, release left mouse button. Click Edit option menu bar click Fill option. In pop-up menu, click Right option. You see data heading “Cost” gets copied adjacent cells. Let us undo changes. A complex use Fill tool use filling series data sheets. Calc provides default lists full abbreviated days week months year. It also enables user create lists. Now, let's insert new heading named “Days” sheet. Under this, display seven days week automatically. Select first seven cells heading “Days”. Now, click Edit option menu bar go Fill option. Click Series option menu. You see dialog-box appears heading “Fill Series”. Now, heading- “Series type”, click “AutoFill” option. In “Start value” field, type first day week, “Sunday”. The increment already set “1”.Now, click OK button. You see days automatically entered cells. You enter weekdays, month year method pre-defined Calc. Another method auto-filling sequential data follows- Type “Sunday” cell press Enter. This shift focus next cell column. Go back cell “Sunday” typed. You see small black box bottom-right-hand corner cell. Click box mouse. Drag downwards till see Saturday display box right. Release mouse button. The cells get filled weekdays automatically. This trick works data sequential. Let us undo changes. You also create one-time fill series numbers entering start, end increment values. To demonstrate this, first delete serial numbers already entered cells “A1” “ A7”. After deleting numbers, select cells referenced “A2” “A7” again. Now, click Edit menu bar Fill Series option. A dialog-box appears front us.Now, click Linear option, heading “Series type”, selected default. In “Start value” field, type first serial number- “1”. In “End value” field, type last value entered “6”. Now, set “Increment” value “1” finally click OK button. We see cells automatically get filled sequential serial numbers. In cases, Fill tool creates momentary connection cells. Once filled, cells connection one another. Apart Fill tools, one speed tool called “Selection lists” limited using text. We discuss later tutorials series. After learning “Fill tools” “Selection lists”, learn share content sheets. Calc enables user enter information cell multiple sheets. This means, instead entering list sheet individually, enter sheets once. In “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” file, entire data Sheet 1. Now, want “Sheet 2” well “Sheet 3” show data Sheet 1. So, click Edit option menu bar click “Sheet” option. Now, click Select. Now, dialog-box appears, using shift key select options Sheet 1, “Sheet 2” Sheet 3. And click OK button. This takes us back Sheet 1. Now, let's enter data “Sheet 1”. For example- cell referenced “F12”, we’ll type “This displayed multiple sheets”. Now, click “Sheet 2” “Sheet 3” tab one other. We see sheets, cell referenced “F12” contains data. Let us undo changes. Next, learn different ways delete edit data cells. To delete data without removing formatting cell, select cell. You see data cell displayed “Input line” field. Now, press Backspace button keyboard. You see data gets deleted. Let us undo changes. To replace data cell, simply select cell type old data. The new data retain original formatting.Let us undo changes. In order change part data cell, without removing contents, double-click cell. Now, navigating cursor, edit cell per requirement. Let us undo changes. This brings us end Spoken Tutorial LibreOffice Calc: To summarize, learned about: Speed using Fill tools Selection lists. Sharing content sheets. Removing data, replacing data, changing part data. Watch video available following link. It summarizes Spoken Tutorial project. If good bandwidth, download watch it.
