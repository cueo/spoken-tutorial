Welcome Spoken tutorial LibreOffice Math. In tutorial, cover following topics: Mark language writing formula formula formatting- Fonts Alignment Spacing. In last tutorial, introduced mark language Math. Now, let us learn Mark language. Let us first open Writer document call 'Math' application, inside Writer. If Writer already open click Insert menu top click Object choose Formula. If Writer open, invoke Windows Start menu. Using Elements window easy method writing formula. But directly writing mark-up language Formula Editor faster way writing formula. Because, mark-up language formula resembles way would read formula English. For example- write 4 3, need type Formula Editor window "4 times 3". Before go next example, let us insert blank line here. Simply type markup "newline" notice new line inserted Writer gray box area. Let us type: "Some example formulae: newline". For readability, press Enter key write: x greater equal y. Here, also number formula. So, type: 1. x greater equal y new line. Press Enter. Notice, Writer gray-box refreshed contents centered. Next, let us write: power 10. And markup is: 2. arrow pointing upward 10 new line press Enter. Notice mathematical symbol Writer gray-box. Now, let us write: square root 16 = 4. Type: 3. sqrt 16 within curly brackets equals 4 new line. Press Enter. Notice formula Writer gray-box. Alright, let us write summation symbol suffix n, denote a1 + a2 + a3 + an. And markup is: 4. sum underscore n new line. Press Enter. Now, let us try integral function. To write Integral f x dx, markup is: 5. int f(x) dx newline notice integral symbol Writer area. Let us save work now. Go File menu top, click Save. Name document "MathExample1". Now, let us learn format formulae wrote . Notice centered don’t lot space them. We use Format menu top making various format changes. Let us first align formulae left. For this, let us click Format menu choose Alignment. In new window, choose Left option click OK button. Notice formulae left aligned now. We change font style choosing Fonts Format menu. Notice various categories here. We set one type font variables, another type functions, another numbers text. To modify font style, click Modify button choose category Variables. Let us choose 'Arial Black' list-box click OK button. And let us save font clicking OK button here. Now, notice font changes Writer gray-box. To increase font size formulae, go Format menu click Font Size . Let us increase Base size ‘18 point’. Click OK. We change relative sizes categories text indexes operators. We also use Default button undo font-size changes made. Notice, font-size changes formulae. Next, let us make changes spacing formulae. Click Format menu choose Spacing. Let us change Spacing, Line spacing Root spacing, 20 percent. As click spacing type, image centre shows location spacing type. Again, choose spacing types various categories. To this, let us click Category button. Or, use Default button undo changes. Let us click OK button now. And notice spacing changes Writer gray-box. More formatting available Elements window. Let us bring Elements window View menu. Here, let us click last icon second row Categories. The tool tip says ‘Formats’. Here, choose placements Subscripts Superscripts, Alignments, Matrix, New Lines Gaps. Let us introduce long gap fifth example, number 5. Click 5. Then Elements window, click Formats > Long Gap. The mark long gap ‘tilde’ character. And short gap, ‘Tiray’ character. Notice new gap number 5. So, ways format formulae. Feel free explore formatting options Math provides. Okay, assignment you: In Writer window, write following formulae using Mark up. Use Elements window necessary. Summation x power 2. Sin power x plus cos power x = 1 (use Functions category Elements window). Continued previous slide, write Summation 1 n x. (use Operators category set limits summation). Change font "Arial" size "18" point. And provide spacing symbols. This brings us end tutorial Mark Language Formula Formatting LibreOffice Math. To summarize, learned following topics: * Mark language writing formula Formula formatting: Fonts, Alignment Spacing.
