Welcome Spoken tutorial LibreOffice Math. In tutorial, learn write: Derivatives Differential equations Integral equations Formulae Logarithms. For this, let us first open example Writer document created previous tutorials- "MathExample1.odt". Here, let us scroll last page document press Control, Enter go new page. Now, type: “Derivatives Differential Equations: ” press Enter key twice. Now, let us call Math clicking Insert menu, Object Formula. Before go ahead, let us increase font-size 18 point. Change Alignment Left add newlines blank lines examples better readability. Let us learn write derivatives differential equations. Math provides easy way writing formulae equations. We treat like fraction use mark over. For example- write total derivative, df dx, mark "df dx" Formula Editor Window. Next, partial derivative, use word ‘partial’ markup looks like: del f del x. We use curly brackets use mark-up ‘partial’. Notice 'del' symbol partial derivatives Writer gray box. Here another example: Newton's second law motion describes relationship acceleration force F equal m a. This written ordinary differential equation as: F equal m d squared x d squared. Notice used various sets curly brackets state order operation equation looks like shown screen. Here another example differential equation. Newton’s law cooling. If theta temperature object time t, write differential equation: d theta d equal minus k theta minus S 'S' temperature surrounding environment. Notice equation Writer gray box. Let us save work now. Go File click Save. Now, let us see write Integral equations. And let us go new page clicking three times slowly, outside Writer gray box press Control, Enter. Type: “Integral Equations: ” press Enter twice. Now, let us call Math Insert > Object menu; increase Font size 18 point change Alignment Left. To write integral symbol, need use mark-up “int” Formula Editor Window. So, given function 'f' real variable 'x' interval 'a, b' real line x-axis, definite integral written Integral b f x dx. We used mark-up ‘int’ denote integral symbol. To specify limits- 'a' 'b', used mark-up ‘from’ ‘to’. Notice formula Writer gray box. Next, let us write example double integral formula calculate volume cuboid. And formula shown screen. As see, mark-up double integral ‘i n t’. Simple.. Similarly, also use triple integral find volume cuboid. And mark triple integral ‘i n t’. We also use subscript mark specify Limits integral. Using subscript, Math places character bottom right integral. So, ways write integral formulae equations Math. Now, let us see write formulae containing logarithms. Let us write fresh Math gray box Math object. Type "Logarithms: " press Enter twice. Call Math again; change Font 18 point align Left. A simple formula using logarithm log 1000 base 10 equal 3. Notice mark here. Here another example: log 64 base 2 equal 6. Let us write integral representation natural logarithm. The natural logarithm equal integral 1 x dx 1 t. And mark looks like shown screen. Let us save examples. Here assignment you: Write following derivative formula: d squared y d x squared equal d dx ( dy dx). Use scalable brackets. Write following integral: Integral limits 0 1 {square root x } dx. Next, write double integral follows: Double integral T { 2 Sin x – 3 y cubed + 5 } dx dy. And using formula: log x power p base b equal p log x base b solve log 1024 base 2. Format formulae. This brings us end tutorial writing Differential Integral equations logarithms LibreOffice Math. To summarize, learned write:* Derivatives Differential equations * Integral equations *Formulae Logarithms.
