Welcome Spoken tutorial LibreOffice Math. In tutorial, cover following topics: * Using Greek characters like alpha, beta, theta pi. * Using Brackets. * Writing steps solve quadratic equation. Let us learn write Greek characters using Math. For this, let us first open example Writer document created last tutorial i.e. "MathExample1.odt". Double-click Gray-box formulae wrote. This brings Math Formula Editor Elements window. Let us click Formula Editor border drag drop right make float. This maximizes Writer window better visibility. Now, Greek characters- example: alpha, beta, theta pi common mathematical formulae. But, won’t find characters Elements window. We write directly using percentage sign followed name character English. For example- write pi, simply type "%pi" Formula Editor. To write lowercase character, type name character lowercase. For example- write alpha lower case, type "%alpha" "%beta". To write uppercase character, type name character uppercase. For example- write gamma upper case, type "%GAMMA" "%THETA". Another way enter Greek characters using Catalog Tools menu. Under Symbol set, select Greek double-click Greek letter list. Notice mark Greek letter alpha displayed list. So, introduce Greek characters formula. Explore Symbols Catalog know mark Greek characters. Let us learn use Brackets formulae. 'Math' know order operation formula. So, use brackets state order operation. For example, write: First add x y, divide 5 result? We type: "5 x + y". Now, really wanted write? No. We want add x y first introducing curly brackets around x y. And mark looks like: 5 x+y curly brackets. So, using brackets help set order operation formula. Let us save work using File menu top choosing Save. Let us write steps solve quadratic equation. We go new page Writer document pressing Control + Enter. Let us type: "Solving Quadratic Equation" call Math Insert > Object > Formula menu. I already typed quadratic equations. I cut paste save time. So, quadratic equation solve: x squared - 7 x + 3 = 0 To solve it, use quadratic formula shown screen. Here, ‘a’ coefficient 'x' squared term, ‘b’ coefficient 'x' term ‘c’ constant. And solve equation substituting 1 a, -7 b, 3 c, formula. So, first let us write mark quadratic equation want solve. First, call Math Insert > Object > Formula menu. In Format Editor window, let us type mark follows: x squared minus 7 x plus 3 = 0. Let us write two newlines entering blank lines better readability. Press Enter type: "Quadratic Formula:". Press Enter. It always good practice break complex formula starting inner elements formula, first. And work way around elements. So, first write inner square root function. And mark square root b squared - 4ac curly brackets. Next, add minus b plus minus expression put inside curly brackets. We make expression numerator adding another set curly brackets add ‘over 2a’ expression. And, finally add x equals beginning two long gaps surrounding equal symbol. And, quadratic formula. This break complex formulae build part part. Next, let us type rest text follows Formula Editor window Where ‘a’ coefficient 'x' squared term, 'b' coefficient 'x' term, 'c' constant followed newline. And type: "We solve equation substituting 1 a, -7 b, 3 c’ followed two newlines. So, mark substitution shown screen. So, substituted numbers using parentheses equation. Okay, assignment you: Complete remaining steps solving quadratic equation. Display two results separately. Format steps changing alignments spacing. Add long gaps newlines wherever necessary. Write following formula: pi similar equal 3.14159. This brings us end tutorial Greek Characters, Brackets Equations LibreOffice Math. To summarize, learned following topics: * Using Greek characters like alpha, beta, theta pi. * Using Brackets * Writing steps solve Quadratic Equation.
