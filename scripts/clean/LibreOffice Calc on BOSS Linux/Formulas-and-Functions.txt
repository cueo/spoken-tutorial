Welcome Spoken Tutorial Formulas Functions LibreOffice Calc. In tutorial, learn about: Conditional Operator If..Or statement Basic statistic functions Rounding numbers. Here, using GNU/Linux operating system LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4. We already learnt apply basic arithmetic operators like addition, subtraction 'average' data. Now, let’s learn useful operators. One commonly used operator Conditional Operator. Conditional Operators- check condition applied data user show results Boolean - TRUE FALSE. Let’s open “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods”. Here, heading “Cost”, listed prices several items. Let’s apply conditional operators analyze results. Let’s click cell referenced B10 type “Condition Result” inside it. Now, click cell referenced C10. The condition’s result applied displayed cell. Note cost “House Rent” rupees 6,000. The cost “Electricity Bill” rupees 800. The cost “House Rent” “Electricity Bill”. We apply different conditions check results. Click cell referenced C10. In cell, type first condition equal C3 greater C4 press Enter key. Since value cell C3 greater value cell C4, result get TRUE. Now, let us change conditional statement equal C3 less C4. Press Enter. The result get FALSE. In manner, apply conditional statements study results. These statements useful dealing large amounts data. You also use If Or condition data print results according condition holds TRUE. Let’s click cell referenced C10 type: equal IF within braces, C3 greater C4 comma, within double quotes “Positive” comma within double quotes “Negative”. This means value cell C3 greater value cell C4, “Positive” displayed else “Negative” displayed. Now, press Enter. Notice result “Positive” since rupees 6000 greater rupees 800. Now, conditional statement, let’s change “greater than” “less than” press Enter key. Note result “Negative” value cell C3 greater value cell C4. You also see change result change data cells C3 C4. The result displayed “Negative”. Now, let us increase value cell C4 7000 press Enter key. The result automatically changes “Positive”. Again, let’s decrease value cell C4 800. And press Enter key. The result automatically changes “Negative”. Now, let us delete changes made. Next, let’s learn arithmetic statistic functions. Basic arithmetic functions include: SUM addition PRODUCT multiplication QUOTIENT division many already learnt earlier tutorials. Now let’s perform operations check Sum, Product Quotient functions work. First let’s select Sheet 3. Enter numbers 50, 100 150 within cells referenced “B1”, “B2” “B3” respectively. Click cell “A4” type “SUM”. Click cell “B4”. We shall compute result cell. Type: equal “SUM” within braces, B1 comma B2 comma B3. Press Enter. Notice result shows 300. You also enter range cells like this- Click B4 again. Now, within braces, instead B1 comma B2 comma B3, type: B1 colon B3. Press Enter. Once again, result shows 300. Now, let’s click cell A5 type “PRODUCT”. Click cell “B5”. Here, type: equal “PRODUCT” within braces, B1 colon B3. Press Enter. Notice result shows 7,50,000. Now, let’s see Quotient works. Click cell referenced “A6” type: “QUOTIENT”. Now, click cell “B6”. We shall use cell compute result. And type: equal QUOTIENT within braces, B2 comma B1. Press Enter. You get result “2”. That 100 divided 50 gives 2. Similarly, perform various arithmetic operations Calc. Now, let’s learn implement Statistic Functions. Statistical functions useful analysis data spreadsheets. For example- functions like COUNT, MIN, MAX, MEDIAN, MODE many statistical nature. First, let us click sheet 1. Let’s see find minimum, maximum median costs, using statistical functions. Let’s click cell referenced “C10” displaying result. Under heading “Cost”, entries. The minimum cost rupees 300. The maximum cost rupees 6000. These results displayed use functions. In cell “C10”, let’s type: equal MAX within braces C3 colon C7. Now press Enter key. Notice result 6000 maximum value column. Now, let’s replace term “MAX” statement “MIN”. And press Enter key. Note result 300 minimum amount Cost column. To find median value, replace term “MIN” “MEDIAN”. And press Enter key. The result shows 800 median cost column. Similarly, use statistical functions data analyze accordingly. Let us delete changes cell. Now, let’s learn round numbers. Let us make changes heading, “Cost”. We shall change:6000 6000.34, 600 600.4, 300 300.3. Now, click cell referenced “B11” type heading “ROUNDING OFF”. Click cell referenced “C11” find total items heading “Cost”. In cell C11, let’s type: equal SUM within braces “C3” colon “C7”. Now, press Enter key. Notice total 9701.04. Now, suppose don’t want decimal places result. The best solution round result nearest whole number. Let us click cell total 9701.04. Type: equal ROUND, open brace “SUM” within braces “C3” colon “C7”. Close brace. Press Enter key. You see, result 9701 9701.04, rounded nearest whole number. Rounding off, also done either lower whole number higher number. Let’s click cell result edit term “ROUND” “ROUNDUP”. Now, press Enter key. You see result 9702 higher whole number. In order round lower whole number, change term “ROUNDUP” “ROUNDDOWN” And press Enter key. The result 9701 lower whole number. Let us undo changes order get “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” original form. This brings us end Spoken Tutorial LibreOffice Calc.
