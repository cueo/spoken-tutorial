Welcome Spoken Tutorial 3D Objects LibreOffice Draw. In tutorial, learn create 3D objects using following options: Extrusion 3D Toolbar 3D Rotation Object. You learn edit apply 3D effects objects create special effects using Duplication. To use tutorial, must familiar Basic Intermediate level tutorials Draw. Here, using: Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 operating system LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4. Let’s create geometry chart shows 2D shape equivalent 3D form. For example, square 2D object, cube 3D form. We new Draw file here, named "3DObjectsChart". Before begin drawing, let’s enable grids guide lines. We learnt previous tutorials. From Main menu, click View, select Grid Display Grid. Then click View, select Guides Display Guides. I want set rulers centimeters. Place mouse pointer horizontal ruler. Now, right-click select Centimeter. Place mouse pointer vertical ruler. Again, right-click select Centimeter. Let us draw text-box top page. Let’s insert text: "Geometric shapes 2D 3D", inside it. Let us divide page two vertical halves using snap line. Click vertical ruler drag Draw page. A vertical dotted line appears. Place dotted line page page divided two halves. Let’s insert text-box left side type "2D Shapes" inside it. Let’s draw another text-box right side type "3D Shapes" inside it. Let us enable 3D toolbars. From Main menu, click View, select Toolbars 3D-Objects. Again, click View, select Toolbars 3D-settings. The 3D-Objects 3D-Settings tool-boxes displayed. We first draw 2D shapes. We draw rectangle, square, circle triangle place one other. The method obtaining 3D object, using 2D object called Extrusion. Basically, surface moved outward create 3D object. First, let us change colour rectangle "Turquoise 1". Let’s make copy rectangle. Let’s drag copied rectangle place right half page. Now, still selected, right-click view context menu. Now, click Convert select To 3D. The 2D rectangle converted cuboid. Let’s type "Rectangle" inside rectangle shape. However, cannot type text inside 3D objects. To type text, need use Text tool. Click Text tool draw text-box inside cuboid. Type text "Cuboid"' inside it. The text-box cuboid treated two separate objects. Therefore, let’s group them. Similarly, colour convert square, circle triangle 3D objects. We used extrusion create chart 2D 3D figures. Pause tutorial assignment. Add new page Draw file. Draw square type text "Square". Convert square text 3D. Compare text 2D square text. Hint: Use 3D Settings toolbar create 3D objects. Draw also provides ready-made 3D shapes. You insert shapes using 3D Objects toolbar. Let’s insert new page Draw file. Let’s select shape 3D-Objects toolbar, say Shell. Then draw page. Draw also allows create 3D objects using body rotation 2D objects. Let’s draw 2D shape, say circle, Draw page. Right-click context menu select Convert. Then choose To 3D Rotation Object. Observe happens circle. It 3D object. Click Fontwork Gallery icon Drawing toolbar bottom. Let us select Favorite 16 click OK button. The text Fontwork displayed Draw page. We re-size text required. Now, may want text place. How that? Simply double-click inside text "Fontwork". Now, able see word Fontwork black colour within larger text. Select text type "Spoken Tutorials". Now, click anywhere Draw page. The words "Spoken Tutorials" displayed page. Next, let us learn apply effects 3D objects. Let us apply effects spherical shape. So, let us select right-click context menu. Now select 3D Effects. You see various options here. For demo purpose, let us change Depth parameter 3cm. Under Segments, let us change Horizontal 12. Under Normal, let us select Flat option. Observe appearance object preview window. Now, click Assign icon top right-hand corner dialog-box. Next, click X mark top left-hand corner exit dialog-box. Observe shape now. The effects selected applied it. Here assignment you. Create similar picture like one shown slide. Use 3D Effects dialog-box achieve this. You also create special effects using Duplication 2D 3D objects. Let’s create new page draw rectangle it. Let us create effect using Duplication 2D rectangle. From Main menu, select Edit click Duplicate. The Duplicate dialog-box appears. Let us enter following values - Number copies = 10 Under Placement, X Axis = 10 Y Axis = 20 Angle = 0 degrees. We keep Enlargement Width Height default. We change Start color Yellow, End color Red. Click OK. Look great special effects got! You get many effects changing angles values. This brings us end tutorial. In tutorial, learnt create 3D objects using following options: Extrusion 3D toolbar 3D Rotation Object. We learnt edit 3D objects apply 3D effects objects. We also learnt create special effects using Duplication'. Watch video available following link. It summarizes Spoken Tutorial project. If good bandwidth, download watch it.
