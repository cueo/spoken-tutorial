Welcome Spoken Tutorial Flowcharts, Glue Points Beizer curvesin LibreOffice Draw. In tutorial, learn draw Beizer curvesand Flowcharts. You also learn connect Flowcharts using Connectors Glue points. Here, using: Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4. Let’s learn Bezier Curves. Bezier Curves used mainly computer graphics make curves smoother. You use curves experiment shape size curves. All curves start point end point. The points curve referred Nodes. Let us go 'Routemap' file. Let’s go Commercial Complex Home. To so, go right Parking Lot. Remember, previously grouped drawing. So, let’s ungroup it. Now, Drawing toolbar, click Curve select Curve. On Draw page, click start point route - Home. Keep left-mouse-button pressed drag till Play Ground. You see straight line. Release mouse button. Now, move pointer Commercial Complex. The line curve mouse moves. Double-click end point, is, Commercial Complex. We drawn curve! Notice curve transition smooth. Now, let us edit points curve using Edit Points toolbar. Click curve. To enable Edit Points toolbar, right-click curve choose Edit Points. When blue boxes appear end-points curve, edit curve. Click start point curve. You see dotted line control point. You drag dotted line reduce expand curve, required. Double-click anywhere Draw page, made change. You use Edit Points toolbar insert, move delete points curve create smoother curve. Here small assignment you. Draw Bezier curve work options using Edit Points toolbar. Now, let us learn create Flowcharts. Let’s add 2 new pages file RouteMap. Draw provides separate option Drawing toolbar Flowcharts. This flowchart shows stages Spoken Tutorial process. Let’s create flowchart. From Drawing toolbar, click Flowcharts. Click small black triangle select Flowchart: Process. Place cursor Draw page, hold left-mouse-button drag down. You drawn Process box. A Process box represents step event entire process. We insert text flowchart objects too. Let’s double-click Process box type text "Create Tutorial Outline chunk content 10-minute scripts" inside it. Formatting options Flowcharts also similar objects. Now, let’s align text inside Process box. Let us select text. Right-click view Context menu click Text. The Text dialog-box appears. In Text dialog-box, check box "Resize shape fit text width". Click OK. You see Process box changed shape fit text! Now, let us undo action pressing Ctrl+Z keys together. Again, let’s select text. Go Main menu select Format click Text. The Text dialog-box appears. Let us check option "Word wrap text shape". Click OK. The text adjusted fit shape Process box. In manner, let us draw another Process box beneath first one. Let us insert text "Create Scripts" inside it. Now, let's draw Decision box insert text "Review Okay?" inside it. A Decision box represents decision made. It directs us next process based outcome decision. Let us draw another Process box beneath Decision box. Let us insert text "Record Video" inside it. Next, need another Decision box text "Review Okay?". Let’s copy Decision box, created before, place here. So, select Decision box press Ctrl+C keys together. Now, press Ctrl+V keys together. Let’s move box beneath previous Process box. Now, enter text "Review Okay" inside it. Finally, let’s draw flowchart-connector type 'A' inside it. A flowchart-connector connects two parts flowchart. Let’s say first part flowchart one page second part another page. We draw flowchart-connector end flowchart first page. Then draw connector beginning second page. Before connect objects, let us learn Connector Lines Glue Points Draw. Connectors lines arrows whose ends attached docked object. Glue points- name indicates points glue connectors objects. All objects glue points. These invisible; become visible connector selected Drawing toolbar mouse pointer moved object. Glue points handles. We use handles re-size object. Glue points used glue connector object. Now, let us connect objects flowchart using connectors. Go Drawing toolbar select Connector. Click small black triangle see different types Connectors. Let us select option Straight Connector ends Arrow. When select Connector, see cross marks objects Draw page. These glue points. Now, let’s draw line glue point first process box glue point next process box. We connect flowchart objects, top-to-down manner, using connectors. You notice every line automatically docks nearest glue point, wherever place cursor. Now, let’s connect Process Decision boxes. From Drawing toolbar, select option Connector Ends Arrow. From Process box, let’s connect Decision box. Similarly, let’s connect Decision box next Process box. You also add text connector. On connector Decision box Process box, let us type: "No". To select connector, double-click it. The end control-points become active text cursor appears. Let us type text "No". Let us connector. We created simple flowchart! Let’s save flowchart pressing Ctrl+S keys. You also connect objects using lines arrows too. But case, group objects. This arrows stay docked objects. How connectors different Lines Arrows? Connectors lines arrows whose end-points automatically docked glue points object. Lines Arrows, hand, dock automatically. Pause tutorial assignment. Create second part Spoken Tutorial flowchart. Color process boxes. Draw connector letter 'A'. It first object flowchart. It look like this. This brings us end tutorial. In tutorial, learnt about: Flowcharts Connectors Glue points.
