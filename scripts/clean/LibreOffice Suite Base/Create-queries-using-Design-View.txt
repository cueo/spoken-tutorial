Welcome Spoken tutorial LibreOffice Base. In tutorial, learn to: * Create query using Design View. * Add tables Query Design window * Select fields Set aliases Set sorting order provide search criteria query. For this, let us consider familiar 'Library' database example. In 'Library' database, stored information books members. And, also table track books issued members. Now create new query list books issued members. In words, let us generate history books issued members. Let's open Library database. Let us click Queries icon left panel. On right panel, click ‘Create Query Design view’. We see new window also called Query Design window. And also see small pop-up window top says Add Table Query. Here define source data query.

We similarly add BooksIssued table Members table. <pause> We see three tables appeared background query design window. Let us close pop-up window. This brings Query design window foreground. Notice three tables top half window. Here, let us introduce space among tables. Let us click, drag drop Members table far right. And click, drag drop BooksIssued table centre. Now see lines linking tables relationships established earlier. We double-click lines see relationship details. For now, let us see bottom half 'Query design' window. This area several rows cells. As design query, fill up. First, check Field column. This specifying fields need display result set. To this, first double-click Title field Books table upper half window. Next Name field Members table. And then, Issue Date field BooksIssued table. Next, Return date,the actual return date. And finally checked field. Notice fields bottom half window first row. Also corresponding table names third row. Next, let us look Alias second row. This enter descriptive names selected fields. So, let us type aliases shown image. <pause> And done aliases.

For example, query books issued returned members. Meaning- checked-in. So, let us click empty cell row, CheckedIn field type ‘Equals Zero’. That's it. Let us run query now. We use keyboard shortcut F5 click Edit menu top window click Run Query bottom. Can see data upper half window? These results query. Notice that, see history books issued members ordered Issue Date. Also notice none books checked-in. Now go query design area change way want . For example, let us remove Checked In criterion. <pause> Now, let us run query pressing F5 again. This time see longer list data returned query. Next, let us save query pressing Control, S. This opens small pop-up window. Let us give descriptive name query here. Let us type ‘History Books Issued Members’ click OK button. close window. We open saved query double-clicking query name main Base window. So, successfully created query using Design View. Here assignment: Generate list books issued member Nisha Sharma. The list chronological Issue date. This brings us end tutorial Creating queries Design View, LibreOffice Base. To summarize, learned to: * Create query using Design View Add tables Query Design window Select fields * Set aliases, Set sorting order And provide search criteria query.
