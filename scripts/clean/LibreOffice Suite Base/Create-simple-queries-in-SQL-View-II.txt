Welcome Spoken tutorial LibreOffice Base. In tutorial, learn to: * Write queries SQL View * Use ORDER BY clause * Use JOINS * Use Aggregate functions * Use GROUP BY clause * And use built Functions. Let us learn writing SQL queries. For this, let us open familiar Library database. Now, let us click Queries list left panel click ‘Create Query SQL View’. First, let us see sort results query. And let us consider following example: Retrieve Book title author information books published Cambridge Oxford sort publisher ascending order, followed book titles ascending order. And query: SELECT Publisher, Title, Author FROM Books WHERE Publisher IN ( 'Cambridge', 'Oxford') ORDER BY Publisher ASC, Title ASC So, notice used ORDER BY clause specify sorting column names. Also notice comma characters help add columns sorting. And specify ascending descending order, simply type 'A S C' 'D E S C' next column name. Now, let us click Run Query icon file menu bar. Here books, first sorted Publisher book title. 02;34 Now, onto next query. Let us get list book titles yet returned members, along book issue dates. Since titles Books table Book Issue date BooksIssued table, need combine two somehow. So, use JOIN keyword, join two tables use common column, BookId, link two tables. So query is: SELECT B.title, I.IssueDate, I.Memberid FROM Books B JOIN BooksIssued I ON B.bookid = I.BookId WHERE CheckedIn = FALSE Notice letters 'B' 'I' FROM clause. These called Aliases either descriptive single alphabets better readability. Notice BookId column tables. So, use aliases specify qualify column names avoid confusion. Okay, notice joined two tables using JOIN keyword FROM clause specified BookId column joining writing: ON B.bookid = I.BookId So, let us run query see list books issue date notice CheckedIn status- checked in. Okay, also notice see MemberId results. Not useful, it? So, display member names members table? Simple. We JOIN members table query follows: SELECT B.Title, I.IssueDate, I.MemberId, M.Name FROM Books B JOIN BooksIssued I ON B.BookId = I.BookId JOIN Members M ON I.MemberId = M.MemberId WHERE CheckedIn = FALSE So, notice second join Members table MemberId column used joining. Let us run query. Here member names along books issued them. Next, let us learn aggregates grouping. How get count members library? Here query: SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Total Members" FROM Members So here, notice COUNT. This called aggregate function returns one value evaluating set records. Also added Alias- ‘Total Members’. Now, let us run query. So here, Base evaluated 4 members records returned number 4 total count members. Some examples aggregate functions SUM, MAX MIN. Now, let us learn grouping information. How get count books publisher? Here query: SELECT Publisher, COUNT(*) AS "Number Books" FROM Books GROUP BY Publisher ORDER BY Publisher Notice new GROUP BY clause. So, selecting Publisher number books GROUP BY clause group records Publisher. Let us run query now. Notice publisher names number books publisher beside them. Next, let us learn using Functions SQL. Functions statements return single value. For example, CURRENT_DATE returns today’s date. So, let us list book titles due returned members. And query is: SELECT B.Title, I.IssueDate, I.ReturnDate FROM Books B JOIN BooksIssued I ON B.bookid = I.BookId WHERE CheckedIn = FALSE ReturnDate < CURRENT_DATE So, notice use CURRENT_DATE function. We retrieving books Return Date past today’s date. Let us run query. And, books due returned. For list functions HSQLdb offers: go http://hsqldb.org/doc/2.0/guide/builtinfunctions-chapt.html The entire user guide accessed visiting website: http://www.hsqldb.org/doc/2.0/guide/ Here assignment: Write test SQL queries following: 1. Get count books Library. 10;58 2. Get count books written author. 3. Get list member names phone numbers need return books today. 4. Explain query does? SELECT (price) AS "Total Cost Cambridge Books" FROM Books WHERE publisher = 'Cambridge' This brings us end tutorial queries SQL View LibreOffice Base. To summarize, learned to: * Create Queries SQL View * Use ORDER BY clause * Use JOINS * Use Aggregate functions * Use GROUP BY clause * And use built Functions.
