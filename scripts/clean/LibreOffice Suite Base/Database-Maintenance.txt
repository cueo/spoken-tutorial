Welcome Spoken tutorial LibreOffice Base. In tutorial , learn to: Maintain Database Modify Database Structure Defragment database Take Backups. Database Maintenance- Throughout life Base database, need take steps keep data up-to-date, reliable safe. This includes modifying data structure updating forms necessary keep data current. Let us consider Library example database built previous tutorials. This database initially tables books, members books issued. And built example forms, queries reports based database structure. Later, library expanded media DVDs CDs. So, modified Library database make structure up-to-date. For this, added another table called Media stored DVD CD information new Media table. This way, database became usable up-to-date made changes whenever necessary. Along table changes, also need modify forms make easier use. Or build new forms accommodate new table structures. For example, form enter books data, modify allow data entry DVDs CDs also. Here could add option buttons choose type media, is: books DVDs CDs. Or, add brand new form allow data entry DVD CD media. Similarly, need modify add new queries reports based data structure changed. And sometimes need modify existing table structures. For example, let us consider Members table lists members Library. It currently stores names phone numbers only. Now, store address city information also, need modify Members table structure. For this, use SQL syntax as: ALTER TABLE Members ADD Address TEXT, ADD City TEXT So, ALTER TABLE statement changes table structure adds two new columns: Address City hold TEXT data. Visit 'hsqldb.org/' website information creating altering table structures. Use 'url' address shown screen. Next, let us see keep Base database reliable use. Sometimes, Base requires huge memory hold comparatively small number records. This because, Base anticipates certain amount memory database may need. And, data see tables stored exactly orderly manner. Because add data tables different times, actual storage particular order. We use indexes table data, like use catalogue Library books. A catalogue lists books, also stores physical location. Similarly, build table indexes locate data efficiently. But indexes also take lot memory. And sometimes, deleting table data purge data completely. They disconnected table indexes still occupy space new data added takes space. So, database grows bigger size, although actual data stored may big. Base offers nice way reorganizing called Defragmenting. For this, open database needs defragmented. Once inside 'LibreOffice Base' window, click Tools menu click SQL sub menu type following command SQL window. CHECKPOINT DEFRAG This SQL command removes unneeded information Base database file. This first close database, reorganize data re-open database. Now, also use another command SQL window- SHUTDOWN COMPACT. The difference command wonâ€™t re-open database. For information defragmenting, visit 'hsqldb.org' Chapter 11. Finally, let us talk Backups help keep database secure. We could lose database due 07;06 computer crashes, Hard disk drive breakdowns Viral infections. LibreOffice good recovery wizard minimizes data loss. But wise thing keep periodic backups database. And taking backup simple. We need make copy database file store secondary media storage external hard disks CDs DVDs flash drives. So, take backup Library database, locate 'Library.odb' file saved. And then, copy paste file different hard disk drive flash drive. Now, single copy paste action takes care backing entire database data structures, data, forms, queries reports it. How often need take backups? This depends often database gets changed terms data structure. Meaning- often add, update delete data. And often modify table structures, forms, queries reports. So, schedule daily weekly backups, depending frequency database usage. Here assignment- Alter Members table add two new columns - Address City. Let columns data type TEXT. Also, open Members table Data Entry mode insert sample address city data. 09;23 Next, Defragment 'Library database'. Finally, take backup Library database, save flash drive another hard disk drive, available. This brings us end tutorial Database Maintenance LibreOffice Base. To summarize, learned to: * Maintain Database * Modify Database Structure * Defragment database * And take Backups.
