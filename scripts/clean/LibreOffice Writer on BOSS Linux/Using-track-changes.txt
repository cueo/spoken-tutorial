Hello Everybody. Welcome tutorial LibreOffice Writer - Track changes Editing document. In tutorial, I explain peer review documents done LibreOffice Writer. We open existing document explain peer review edit document using Record Changes option. The benefit using feature reviewer give comments, add text, delete modify existing text clearly visible such, document. This easily seen author accept reject changes thus incorporate edit comments without effort making changes again. And file saved, comments incorporated. So, let's learn this. Here, using: Linux operating system LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4. In tutorial, I using documents I already created saved system, namely- * "Seven-reasons-to-adopt-FOSS.odt" * "Government-support-for-FOSS-in-India.odt". click Applications >> Office >> LibreOffice Writer start Writer. Open "Seven-reasons-to-adopt-FOSS.odt". To set Record changes option on, go Edit â†’ Changes check Record option. The Show option also checked. This enable subsequent editing recorded distinctly. In document, let us insert second point. We go point number 2 type: "Linux virus resistant operating system since user distinct data space cannot directly access program files". Hit Enter current second point becomes point number 3. Note text input come new color. Hover mouse text. You see message "Inserted sriranjani:" followed date time insertion. Thus person making comment identified document. The name provided based name given installation LibreOffice user computer. Correct spelling avalable first line. You notice correction. Delete first point - "It installed computers without restriction needing pay license fees vendors". Note deletion actually delete line marks line suggested deletion. Hover cursor see message Deleted SriRanjani: followed date time deletion . In manner, modifications made document adding, deleting changing existing text document. More one person edit document. LO Writer show edit different colour help reader distinguish one reviewer's work another. Of course, hovering mouse edited text display name reviewer. I going demonstrate opening document already edited colleague Guru. Open text file document- "Government-support-for-FOSS-in-India.odt". In document, see several additions deletions done. Hovering mouse text gives message addition deletion done Guru. Add point bottom "CDAC, NIC, NRC-FOSS institutions Government India develop promote FOSS". We see colour insertion different colour edits done Guru. Hovering mouse insertion gives message Inserted: SriRanjani. Thus, one person edit document goes back author. Close document without saving it. We show author accept reject changes made reviewer. In document, "Government-support-for-FOSS-in-India.odt", let's assume I author I accept reject edits made Guru. Go point number 2 right-click deleted text "reasons" say Accept Change. You see text gets deleted change suggested reviewer. Right-click inserted text "needs" select Accept Change. You see text becomes normal change suggested reviewer. In way, edits suggested reviewer, insertions deletions, accepted author. Go point number 1 right-click deleted text: "The OpenOffice document standard (ODF) notified policy" select Reject Change. This makes text normal i.e. suggestion reviewer delete, rejected author. Go point number 5 right-click "Government Schools states Orissa, Karnataka Tamil Nadu learn Linux" select Reject Change. This deletes text inserted reviewer. In manner, addition deletion accepted rejected author. Finally, accepting rejecting changes, go Edit >> Changes uncheck Record Show options. When unchecked, editing marked separately. Please sure save file accepting rejecting changes incorporate comments given reviewers. This brings us end tutorial.
