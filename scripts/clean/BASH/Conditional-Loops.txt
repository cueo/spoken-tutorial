Dear friends, welcome spoken tutorial loops BASH. In tutorial, learn: * loop * loop examples. To record tutorial, I using: * Ubuntu Linux 12.04 Operating System * GNU BASH version 4.1.10 Please note, GNU bash version 4 recommended practice tutorial. Let us start introduction loops. Loops used execute group statements repeatedly. Let us see syntax. expression 1, 2, 3 statement 1, 2, 3 end loop. An alternate syntax loop is: variable sequence/range statement 1, 2, 3 end loop. Let us see example loop using first syntax. In program, calculate sum first n numbers. Note filename for.sh. This shebang line. The variable number store value given user. The value integer here. Now, initialize variable sum zero. This begin loop. First, initialize 'i' 1. Then check whether 'i' less equal number. Now here, calculate sum sum plus print it. After this, increment value 'i' 1. And check condition till condition False. On exiting loop, message printed. Let us execute program observe happens. On terminal, type - chmod +x for.sh Then type: ./for.sh I enter 5 input number. The sum calculated value 'i' displayed. After that, last line output displayed: "Sum first n numbers 15". Now, let us see flow program. Let resize windows. First, value 'i' 1. Then check whether 1 less equal 5. Since condition True, calculate sum 0 + 1. Now sum 1. Then print sum i.e 1. Next, 'i' incremented 1 new value 'i' 2. Then check whether 2 less equal 5. The condition True sum 1 + 2 i.e 3. 'i' incremented 1 new value 'i' 3. And get sum 6. The script continue add next value 'i' previous value sum. This continue till i<=5 False. On exiting loop, final message printed. Let us see another example loopusing second syntax. I written code file named for-loop.sh. This simple program list files directory. This shebang line. Then loop. 'ls' command lists directory content. -1 (hyphen one) lists one file per line. This list files present home directory. This end loop. Let us execute script terminal typing - chmod +x for-loop.sh Type: ./for-loop.sh This display files present Home directory. Now learn loop. Let us understand syntax first. condition statement 1, 2, 3 end loop. This means loop execute long condition True. Let us see example loop. Here, I named while.sh. In program, calculate sum even numbers within given range. Let us go code. Here, accept number user store variable number. Next, declare variables 'i' sum initialize 0 (zero). Now, condition. Here, check whether 'i' less equal value number given user. Then calculate sum adding value 'i' value sum. Next, increment value 'i' 2. This ensure add even numbers. And loop repeated till value 'i' exceeds value number. When exit loop, print sum even numbers within given range. Let us execute program. Type terminal: chmod +x while.sh ./while.sh I give 15 input. The last line output is: "Sum even numbers within given range 56". Let resize window explain output. First check whether 'i' 0, less equal number 15. The condition True. Hence sum '0+0' i.e 0. Now 'i' incremented 2 new value 'i' 2. Then check 2 less equal 15. The condition True; add 0+2. Now sum value 2. Again value 'i' incremented 2. So, value 'i' 2+2 i.e 4. And next value sum 4+2 i.e 6. In way, script continue add 2 previous value 'i', till exceeds 15. And get total value sum 56. This brings us end tutorial. Let us summarize. In tutorial, learned two different syntax loop also learned loop. As assignment - find sum first "n" prime numbers. Watch video available link shown below. It summarizes Spoken-Tutorial project.
