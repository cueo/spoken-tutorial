Welcome spoken tutorial Globbing Export command. In tutorial, learn about: * Globbing * export command. To follow tutorial, You familiar Linux Operating System. If not, relevant tutorials, please visit website shown. For tutorial, I using: * Ubuntu Linux 12.04 OS * GNU Bash version 4.1.10 Please note, GNU Bash version 4 recommended practice tutorial. Let us start introduction globbing. Filename pathname expansion carried BASH known Globbing. Globbing recognizes expands wildcards. It also interprets standard wildcard characters like- # * (asterisk) # ? (Question mark). Let us understand help example. Open terminal window pressing Ctrl+Alt T keys simultaneously keyboard. On Terminal, type: ls space asterisk dot sh press Enter. It matches files ".sh" extension present directory. Here, see sh files listed. Let clear prompt. Now type: ls space asterisk dot sh press Enter. We see asterisk dot sh matches files starting character "sh" extension. Let's move ... Now, type: ls space opening square bracket hyphen c closing square bracket asterisk dot sh press Enter. This match display files starting letter 'a' 'b' 'c.' Observe output. We see list files starting character 'a' 'b' 'c.' And files "sh" extension. Now, let's go ahead type: ls space opening square bracket caret-sign hyphen c closing square bracket asterisk dot sh press Enter. This match file-names extension "sh" omit starting character 'a' OR 'b' OR 'c'. Observe output. You notice file names starting character 'a', 'b' 'c'. Let clear prompt. Now type: ls space opening square bracket capital 'A' small 'a' closing square bracket asterisk-sign dot sh press Enter. This match file names starting upper lower case letter 'A'. See output. All file names starting upper lower case 'A' extension "sh" listed. Now let's see Export command BASH. Switch slides. In Bash, variables local Shell. Local variables used Shell current Shell. Export command- exports variable function environment child processes. * Can also change local variable global variable. We try understand example. Switch Terminal, type: myvar equal sign lion press Enter. Now type: echo space dollar-sign myvar press Enter. lion printed. This value assigned variable myvar. Now, let's navigate new Shell. To go new Shell, either open new Terminal type: slash bin slash bash press Enter. Now, let's check value variable myvar. Type: echo space dollar-sign myvar press Enter. An empty line printed. This means value assigned variable myvar transferred Shell. Also, variable myvar local previous Shell current Shell. We type exit get back previous Shell. So, declare variables globally, use export command. Let's learn how. Type: export space myvar equal sign lion press Enter. Now type: echo space dollar sign myvar press Enter. lion displayed. Let's navigate another Shell. Type: slash bin slash bash press Enter. Let clear prompt. Now type: echo space dollar-sign myvar. lion displayed This declared variable myvar globally using export command. This brings us end tutorial. Let us summarize. Come back slides.
