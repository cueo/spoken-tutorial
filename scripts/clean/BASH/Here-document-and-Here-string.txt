Dear friends, welcome spoken tutorial HERE document strings. In tutorial, learn special-purpose redirection called Here documents Here strings help examples. To follow tutorial, knowledge Shell Scripting BASH. If not, relevant tutorials, please visit website shown. http://www.spoken-tutorial.org For tutorial, I using: * Ubuntu Linux 12.04 Operating System * GNU BASH version 4.2 Please note, GNU Bash version 4 recommended practice. Let us learn 'Here' document. * It special purpose block text code. * It form I/O redirect. * It feeds command list interactive program command line. * It treated separate file. * It also treated multiple line input redirected shell script. Syntax is- command space less less space HERE. After this, next line, give text inputs. It consist number lines. Here, text1, text2, textN text inputs. After text inputs, next line, type keyword HERE again. It denotes closing HERE document. Let us understand example. I open file named dot sh . The first line code shebang line. Let put block code line. 'wc' represents word count. wc hyphen w counts number words HERE document. The block code text second occurrence HERE treated file. The content present HERE document input command wc hyphen w. HERE acts delimiter wc hyphen w command reading multi-line input. If try execute command terminal, get '4' output. This passed four words command wc hyphen w. Now click Save save file. Let us switch Terminal using Ctrl, Alt T keys simultaneously keyboard. Type: chmod space plus x space dot sh Press Enter. Type: dot slash dot sh Press Enter. We see output 4 is, number words 'Here' document 4. Come back program. Let us add two words here, beginning text. Hello welcome Bash learning. Click Save. Let us execute program again. On terminal, type: dot slash dot sh Press Enter. Now output 6 added two words text. We also pass argument Here document. Let us see example. Let open file named hereoutput dot sh. The command cat concatenate files print standard output. Note used string "this" instead "HERE". Itâ€™s necessary always use delimiter HERE. You use delimiter also. This line display 0th (zeroth) argument. The 0th (zeroth) argument, default, filename. This line display 1st argument passed program. And line display 2nd argument passed program. Here close document using delimiter this. Save file. Let us execute program. On terminal, type: chmod space plus x space hereoutput dot sh. Press Enter Type: dot slash hereoutput dot sh space Sunday space Monday The output displayed as: "0'th argument is: dot salsh hereoutput dot sh" filename. "1st argument is: Sunday" "2nd argument is: Monday" . Let us learn "Here" string now. * Here string used input redirection text variable. * The input mentioned line within single quotes. The syntax is- command space three 'less symbols' space within single quotes write string Let us understand example. I open file dot sh. Here end, I type: wc space hyphen w three less symbols space within single quotes Welcome Bash learning. This redirect string within quotes command wc hyphen w. Now click Save save changes. We switch Terminal. Now type: dot slash dot sh. We see output 6 4. Number words document 6 number words string 4. Likewise, write Here strings. This brings us end tutorial. Let us summarize. In tutorial, learnt about: * HERE document * HERE string. As assignment, convert string uppercase using: * Here document * Here string. Hint: tr space hyphen z space capital A hyphen capital Z.
