Welcome spoken tutorial Loops C C++. In tutorial learn, loop, loop do…while loop. We help examples. We also see common errors solutions. To record tutorial, I using Ubuntu Operating System version 11.04, gcc g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 Ubuntu. Let us start introduction loops. Loops used execute group instructions repeatedly. Depending purpose divided three types: loop do…..while loop loop Let us start loop first. A loop tests condition beginning. The structure is: ( condition ) within bracket statement block. Now move do….while loop . A do..while loop executed least condition could validated. The structure is: (within brackets) statement block, bracket ( condition ). You see condition checked end. Now,let us see example loop do...while loop . I already typed code editor. Let open it. Note file name while.c.. Today going learn addition first 10 numbers using loop. Let explain code now. This header file. Inside main() function declared two integer variables x y initialized 0. This loop. The condition loop x less equal 10. Here value x added value y. The value obtained addition stored y. Then print value y. Here x incremented. That means variable x increased one. And return statement. Now,let us execute program. Please open terminal window pressing Ctrl, Alt T keys simultaneously keyboard. Type gcc space dot c space hyphen o space Press Enter. Type ./while (dot slash while). Press Enter. The output displayed. Now lets us see working loop. Let resize window. Here, first value x y 0. This condition. Here check whether x less equal 10 means values x 0 10. Then add y plus x (i.e) 0 plus 0, get 0. We print value y, get 0. Then x incremented means value x 1. Then check condition again, 1 less equal 10. If condition true add values, y (i.e ) 0 plus x 1. 0 plus 1 1. We print value 1. Again x incremented. Now value x 2. We check condition again. 2 less equal 10, condition true add values, (i.e ) 1 plus 2 give 3. We print value 3. Like this, go x less equal 10 (x<=10). Now, see program using do….while loop . Here program. Note file name hyphen dot c . This part already explained previous program. So, let us move do...while loop . Here, first body loop executed condition checked. The value x added value y value obtained addition stored y. The logic program. Now let us execute program. Come back terminal. Type gcc space hyphen dot c space hyphen o space . Press Enter . Type dot slash (./do). Press Enter . We see output similar program. Now, let us see working do...while loop . Let resize window. Here value x y 0. We add values. Then get 0. Now value y 0. We print value 0. Then x incremented 1 means value x 1, condition checked. You see body loop executed first. Anyhow, condition false also get value 0. Now, check whether 1 less equal 10. The condition true. Again add values. Now 0 plus 1. Then print value y 1. Again x incremented. Now value x 2. Then check 2 less equal 10. We go back here. Then add values. 1 plus 2 3. We print value y 3. Like this, conditions checked till value x less equal 10. And return statement. Note condition ends semicolon. In loop condition end semicolon. Now let us see execute programs C++. This program C++. The logic implementation C program. There changes like header file iostream place stdio.h. We included 'using' statement using namespace std used cout function place printf function. The structure loop C program. Lets us execute program. Come back terminal. Let clear prompt. To execute, type g++ space dot cpp space hyphen o space while1 . Press Enter . Type dot slash while1 (./while1). Press Enter . You see output similar program C. Now let us see do... program C++. Come back text editor. Here also similar changes like header file , using statement cout function. Rest things similar. Lets us execute program. Come back terminal. Type g++ space hyphen dot cpp space hyphen o space do1 . Press Enter . Type dot slash do1 (./do1). Press Enter . We see output similar do...while program C. Now see common errors solutions. Come back text editor. Suppose, I increment value x. Click Save. Let us see happens. Come back terminal. Let clear prompt. Lets us execute program. Press up-arrow key twice. Again press up-arrow key. The output displayed. We see number zeros, loop terminating condition . It known infinite loop. Infinite loop cause system become unresponsive. It causes program consume processors time terminated. Come back program, let us fix error. Type x++ semicolon. Click Save. Let us execute again. Come back terminal. Press up-arrow key. Yes, working. This brings us end tutorial. We move back slides. Let us summarize. In tutorial learned, loop . example. while(x less equal 10) do….while loop . example. statement block condition end. As assignment, write program print following, using loops. 0 9. The syntax loop (variable initialization; variable condition; variable increment decrement) body loop. Watch video available link shown below. It summarizes Spoken Tutorial project.
