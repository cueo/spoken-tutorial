Welcome spoken tutorial Logical operators C C++. In tutorial learn Logical operators like: Logical AND e.g. expression1 && expression2 Logical OR eg. expression1 OR expression2 Logical NOT eg. (Expression1) We help examples. To record tutorial, I using: Ubuntu 11.10 operating system, gcc g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 Ubuntu. Let us start introduction logical operators. In C C++, true value 0. Non zero means true zero means false. Expressions using logical operators return 1 true 0 false. Now I'll explain logical operators help example. Here program logical operators C. Inside main block, statement declares variables a,b c integers. The printf statement prompts user enter values a,b c. The scanf statement takes input user variables a, b c. Here, We comparing values b c find greatest. To compare simultaneously, use logical AND operator. Here, conditions true logical AND return true value. The expression evaluated encountering false condition. So, expression (a>c) evaluated (a>b) true. If less b, expression won't evaluated further. This statement evaluated previous condition true. Next (b>c) evaluated. If condition true, b greatest displayed screen. Otherwise c greatest displayed screen. We come logical OR operator. Here, one conditions true logical OR return true value. The expression evaluated encountering true condition. So, == zero, remaining two expressions won't evaluated. This printf statement executed either a, b c 0. Coming end program. return 0 ending curly bracket. Now save program. Save extension .c (dot c). I saved file logical.c. Open terminal pressing Ctrl, Alt T keys simultaneously. To compile code type gcc space logical dot c space minus o space log. Press Enter. To execute, type ./log (dot slash log) Press Enter. I enter values as: 0, 34, 567 The output displayed as: c greatest. The product a, b c zero. You try executing program different sets inputs. Now Let's write program C++. I already made program take it. Here code C++. Now make program C++, make changes. There's change header file. using statement used. Also difference output input statements. The operators behave way C. Click Save. Make sure file saved extension .cpp (dot cpp). Open terminal pressing Ctrl, Alt T keys simultaneously. To compile program type g++ logical.cpp space minus o space log1. Press Enter. To execute, type ./log1 (dot slash log1). press Enter. I enter values as: 0, 34, 567 So see output similar C program. You try executing program different sets inputs too. Now let us see error come across. Let's switch editor. Suppose forgot brackets. Delete this. Let's see happen, save program. Come back terminal. Compile execute before. We see error: Expected identifier '(' token. This two different expressions here. We evaluate one expression, using AND operator. Now let us go back program fix error. Let us insert brackets here. Click Save. Come back terminal. Compile execute before. So working now. Let us summarize tutorial. In tutorial learnt * Logical AND, eg. ((a > b) && (a > c)) * Logical OR, eg. (a == 0 b == 0 c == 0) Assignment- Write program takes two numbers input user. Check whether two numbers equal using NOT operator.
