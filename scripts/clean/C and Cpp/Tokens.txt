Welcome spoken tutorial Tokens C C Plus Plus. In tutorial learn , How define use tokens. We help example. We also see common errors solutions. To record tutorial, I using Ubuntu Operating system version 11.10, gcc g++ Compiler version 4.6.1. Let us start introduction. Token generic word data types, variables, constants identifiers. Let us start program. I already typed code editor. Let open it. Note file name 'tokens.c'. In program initialize variables print values. Let explain code now. This header file. This main function. Here, int keyword. The compiler knows meaning keyword. integer variable. We assigned value 2 it. This called initialization. If value assigned variable called declaration variable. Here, b constant. We initialized 'b' assigning value 4 it. const keyword used create 'read only' variable. Let us switch back slides know keywords constant. Keywords fixed meanings cannot changed. Keywords cannot used variable names. There 32 keywords C. To name some, auto, break, case, char, enum, extern, etc. Constants: constants fixed values. They change execution program. There two types constants, Numeric constants Character constants. Now come back program. Here, float data type variable c. We assigned value 1.5. Data type finite set values along set rules. Here, d variable. char single quotes suggest dealing character. As result, d character variable storing value A. It easy see int, double, float char data types. a, c d variables. Now come back slides. We know data types variables. Data types: Let us begin integer data type. It declared int. If want print integer data type , use %d format specifier. Similarly, use float %f floating point numbers. For character data type, use char %c. And For double data type, use double %lf format specifier. Now see range data types. Integer data type range Floating point range Character range And Double range The values stored variable must greater less range. Now move variables. Variable data name. It may used store data value . The values change program runs. Before using variable must declared. We try give meaningful names variables. example john, marks, sum etc. Now move back program. Here, printf identifier name function. Come back slides. Let us know identifiers. Identifiers user defined names. An identifier consists letters digits. Both uppercase lowercase letters permitted. First character must alphabet underscore. Now Come back program. Here initialized variables constants. Here print them. And return statement. Now click Save. Let us execute program. Please open terminal window pressing Ctrl, Alt T keys simultaneously keyboard. To compile, type gcc space tokens dot c space hyphen o tok. Press Enter. To execute, type ./tok (dot slash tok). The output displayed. We see six values decimal point. And two values. Now let us find happened. Come back program. This % point 2f here. It denotes print two values decimal point. Suppose I want output three decimal places. Let us replace % point 2f % point 3f. Now click Save. Come back terminal. Compile before, execute before. We see three values decimal point. Now execute program c++. Come back program. I change things here. First press Shift+Ctrl+s keys simultaneously keyboard. Now save file extension .cpp click Save. Let us change header file iostream Now include using statement. And click Save. Now replace printf statement cout statement since use cout<< function print line C++. Click Search replace text option. Type printf opening bracket “(” And column type, cout two opening angle brackets “<<”. Now click Replace All click Close. We don't need format specifier '\n' Let us delete them. Now delete comma type two opening angle brackets. Click Save. Now delete closing bracket. Type two opening angle brackets again. And within double quotes type \n. Now Click Save. Let us execute program. Come back terminal. To compile, type g++ space tokens dot cpp space hyphen o space tok1. Here tok1 don't want overwrite output parameter tok file tokens.c. Now press Enter. To execute, type ./tok1 . Press Enter. The output displayed. Now let us move common errors come across. Come back program. Suppose I reassign new value b 8. Now click Save. Let us see happens. Come back terminal. Let clear prompt. Now compile before. We see error line no.7 tokens. cpp file. "Assignment read variable 'b' ". Come back program. This 'b' constant. Constants fixed values. They change execution program. Hence giving error. Let us fix error. Delete this. Click Save. Let us execute again. Come back terminal. Compile before. Execute before. Yes, working. Now see another common error. Switch back program. Suppose I miss single quotes. Click Save. Let us execute. Come back terminal. Compile before. We see error line no.9 tokens dot cpp file. " 'A' declared scope". Come back program. This anything within single quotes considered character value. And declared 'd' character variable. Let us fix error. Type single quotes line no.9 here. Now Click Save. Let us execute. Come back terminal. Now Compile before. Execute before. Yes working. Now switch back slides. Let us summarize. In tutorial learnt, * Data types eg. int, double, float etc. * Variables eg. int a=2; * Identifiers eg. printf() * Constant eg. double const b=4; As assignment, Write program calculate simple interest. Hint: principal * rate * time upon 100. Watch video available link shown below. It summarizes Spoken Tutorial project. If good bandwidth, download watch it.
