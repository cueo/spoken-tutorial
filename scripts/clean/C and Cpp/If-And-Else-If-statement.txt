Welcome spoken tutorial Conditional statements C C++. In tutorial learn: *How execute single statement *How execute group statements. We examples. We also see common errors solutions. To record tutorial, I using Ubuntu Operating system version 11.10. gcc g++ Compiler version 4.6.1. Let us start introduction conditional statements. A statement program controls flow program execution. It helps make decision code executed. We check conditions, whether true false. We execute single statement group statements. Let us understand flow statements. Here, condition true statement 1 executed. If condition false statement 2 executed. Now see flow else statement. Here, condition 1 true statement 1 executed. If condition 1 false check another condition condition 2. If condition 2 true statement 3 executed. And If condition 2 false statement 2 executed. Now Let us move program. I already typed code editor. So, let open it. Note file name ifstmt.c. In program calculate sum two numbers check conditions. Let explain code now. This header file. This main() function. Here declared three integer variables a, b sum. Here asking user input. User enter values b. The values stored variable variable b. The scanf() function reads data console. It stores result given variable. The format specifier scanf() helps know type data. Like %d, denotes dealing integer data type. Here add values b. We store result sum. Then print result. This statement. Here, check condition whether sum greater 20. If condition true, print Sum greater 20. Now let comment lines. This return statement. Now click Save. First see execution statement. Please open terminal window pressing Ctrl, Alt T keys simultaneously keyboard. To compile, type gcc space ifstmt dot c space -o space press Enter. To execute, type ./if (dot slash if). Press Enter. It displayed Enter values b. I give values 10 12. The output displayed Sum b 22. Sum greater 20. Now come back program. We check another condition. Let remove comment here. I give comment here. Now click Save. This else-if statement. Here, check another condition whether Sum greater 10. If condition true print 'Sum greater 10 less 20'. Now come back terminal. Let us compile before. Let us execute before. It displayed Enter value b. I give values 10 2. The output displayed as: Sum b 12. Sum greater 10 less 20. Let clear prompt. Now come back program. I remove comment here. Now click Save. If conditions false print 'Sum less 10'. This else statement. Now let us execute see. Come back terminal. Let us compile before. Let us execute before. Here displayed Enter value b. I give values 3 5. The output displayed sum b 8. Sum less 10. Now see common errors come across. Come back program. Suppose, end statement I type semicolon (;). Let us see happen. Click Save. Let us execute. Come back terminal. Let us compile before. We see error: 'else' without previous 'if' Come back program. It syntax error. statement never terminate semicolon. And else statement never work without if. Let us fix error. Delete semicolon (;) here. Now Click Save. Let us execute. Come back terminal. Let us compile before. Let us execute before. Enter value b. I give values 3 6. The output displayed Sum b 9. Sum less 10. NOW WE WILL SEE HOW TO EXECUTE THE SAME PROGRAM IN C++. Come back program. I change things here. Press Shift, Ctrl S keys simultaneously keyboard. Now save file extension dot cpp click Save. We change header file iostream. Let us include using statement here. Now click Search replace text option. Let us replace printf statement cout statement. Click Replace click Close. Now delete closing brackets here. Replace scanf() statement cin statement. Type cin two closing angle brackets >>. As use cin >> function read line C++. Now delete format specifiers. Delete comma ampersand &. Delete comma type two closing angle brackets. Again delete ampersandand closing brackets. Now click Save. Here delete closing bracket comma. Now delete backslash n (\n) format specifier. Now type two opening brackets. Again type two opening angle brackets within double quotes type backslash n “\n”. Here also delete closing bracket. Now delete closing bracket here. Now click Save. Let us execute. Come back terminal. Let clear prompt. To compile, type g++ space ifstmt.cpp space -o space if1 Here 'if1' don't want overwrite output parameter file 'ifstmt.c'. Now Press 'Enter'. To execute type ./if1 (dot slash if1) press Enter. Enter value b. I give values 20 10. The output displayed Sum b 30 Sum greater 20 This brings us end tutorial. Now come back slides. Let us summarize. In tutorial learned 'if' statement eg. if(condition), And 'else if' statement eg. else if(condition). As assignment, Write program check 'a' greater 'b' less 'b'. Hint: use 'if' statement. Write another program check value greater 'a', 'b' 'c'. Hint: use 'else-if' statement. Watch video available link shown below. It summarizes Spoken Tutorial project.
