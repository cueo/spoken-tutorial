welcome spoken tutorial arithmetic operators c c tutorial learn arithmetic operators like addition eg ab subtraction eg ab division eg ab multiplication eg ab modulus eg ab record tutorial using ubuntu 1110 operating system gcc g compiler version 461 ubuntu demonstrate use arithmetic operations help c program already written program open editor explain code c program arithmetic operators first two statements variables declared defined next two statements assigned value 5 b assigned value 2 lets see addition operator works c holds sum b printf statement displays sum b screen dot 2f provides precision two digits decimal point next statement c holds product b printf statement displays product b screen lets see two operators work comment following lines type slash asterisk click save save file extension c dot c saved file arithmeticc open terminal window pressing ctrl alt keys simultaneously compile code type following terminal gcc space arithmetic dot c space minus o space arith press enter execute code type arith dot slash arith press enter output displayed screen shows sum 5 2 700 product 5and 2 1000 try subtraction operator try replacing addition operator subtraction operator get result 3 coming back program last set statements explain code division remove multiline comments statements c holds value integer division b please note integer division fractional part truncated printf statement displays division output screen statement performing real division one operands cast float typecast variable behave float variable single operation printf statement displays output real division screen type return 0 close ending curly bracket click save coming back terminal compile execute code compile typegcc space arithmetic dot c minus o space arith press enter execute code type arith press enter output displayed screen previous outputs addition multiplication operators integer division 5 2 2 see integer division fractional part truncated real division 5 2 25 real division result expected used typecasting obtain results suppose want write program c lets see use code c lets find let go back editor c code notice header different c file header namespace also used also notice output statement c cout apart differences two codes similar click save make sure file saved extension cpp saved file arithmeticcpp lets execute code see results get open terminal type g space arithmetic dot cpp space minus o arith press enter execute code type arith press enter output displayed see results similar c program difference precisions outputs let us summarize tutorial tutorial learnt use arithmetic operators assignment write program demonstrate use modulus operator please note modulus operator finds remainder division eg c b obtain result 1 watch video available following link summarizes spoken tutorial project good bandwidth download watch spoken tutorial project team conducts workshops using spoken tutorials gives certificates pass online test details please write contact spoken hyphen tutorial dot org spoken tutorial project part talk teacher project supported national mission education ict mhrd government india information mission available spoken hyphen tutorial dot org slash nmeict hyphen intro ritwik joshi iit bombay thank joining
