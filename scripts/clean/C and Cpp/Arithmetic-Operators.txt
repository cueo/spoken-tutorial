Welcome spoken tutorial Arithmetic Operators C And C++. In tutorial, learn about: Arithmetic operators like '+' Addition: e.g. a+b. '-' Subtraction: e.g. a-b. '/' Division: e.g. a/b. '*' Multiplication: e.g. a*b. '%' Modulus: e.g. a%b. To record tutorial, I using: Ubuntu 11.10 operating system gcc g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 Ubuntu. I demonstrate use arithmetic operations help C program. I already written program. So, I open editor explain code. Here C program arithmetic operators. In first two statements, variables declared defined. In next two statements, assigned value 5. b assigned value 2. Now let's see addition operator works. c holds sum b. This printf statement displays sum b screen. Here % dot 2f provides precision two digits decimal point. In next statement, c holds product b. This printf statement displays product b screen. Let's see two operators work. We comment following lines. Type /* (slash asterisk) */ Click Save. Save file extension .c (dot c). I saved file arithmetic.c. Open terminal window pressing Ctrl, Alt T keys simultaneously. To compile code, type following terminal. gcc space arithmetic dot c space minus o space arith Press Enter. To execute code, type ./arith (dot slash arith). press Enter. The output displayed screen. It shows, Sum 5 2 7.00 Product 5and 2 10.00. Now try subtraction operator own. Try replacing addition operator subtraction operator. You get result 3. Coming back program last set statements. Now, I explain code division. Remove multiline comments here. In statements, c holds value integer division b. Please note integer division fractional part truncated. The printf statement displays division output screen. In statement performing real division. Here one operands cast float. We type-cast variable a. Now behave float variable single operation. The printf statement displays output real division screen. Type return 0; close ending curly bracket. Click Save. Coming back terminal compile execute code. To compile, typegcc space arithmetic dot c minus o space arith. Press Enter. To execute code, type ./arith. Press Enter. The output displayed screen. We previous outputs addition multiplication operators. We integer Division 5 2 2. We see integer division fractional part truncated. Then real division 5 2 2.5. In real division, result expected. We used type-casting obtain results. Now suppose, I want write program C++. Let's see I use code C++ too? Let's find out. Let go back editor. Here C++ code. Notice header different C file header. namespace also used here. Also, notice output statement C++ cout. So, apart differences, two codes similar. Click Save. Make sure file saved extension .cpp. I saved file arithmetic.cpp. Let's execute code see results get. Open terminal type g++ space arithmetic dot cpp space minus o arith . Press Enter. To execute code, type ./ arith. Press Enter. Here output displayed. So, see results similar C program. The difference precisions outputs. Let us summarize tutorial. In tutorial learnt use arithmetic operators. As assignment: Write program demonstrate use modulus operator. Please note Modulus operator finds remainder division. e.g. c = % b; You obtain result 1. Watch video available following link. It summarizes Spoken Tutorial project.
