Hello and welcome to the spoken tutorial on Command Line Arguments.

 00:07
In this tutorial, we will learn about  main() function with arguments, with an example.

 00:15
For this tutorial, I am using  Ubuntu Operating system version 11.10 and  gcc Compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu.

 00:27
 To follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with C tutorials.

 00:33
 If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown.

 00:39
Let us start with our program. I have a code file. I will open it.

 00:45
File name is main hyphen with hyphen args.c.

 00:50
Let me explain the program.

 00:53
These are the header files. stdio.h defines core input and output functions.

 01:01
 stdlib.h header file defines-
 Numeric conversion function
 Pseudo-random numbers
 Generation function
 Memory allocation
 Process control functions.


01:16
This is our main() function. Inside this, we have passed two arguments-
int argc,  char  asterisk asterisk argv (**argv).

 01:28
 argc refers to the number of command line arguments passed to the program.

 01:34
This includes the actual name of the program.

 01:38
argv contains actual arguments starting from index 0.

 01:44
Index 0 is the name of the program.

 01:48
Index 1 will be the first argument passed to the program.

 01:53
Index 2 will be the second argument passed to the program and so on.

 01:59
This statement will display the total number of arguments passed to the program.

 02:05
This will display the first argument passed to the program.

 02:09
1 represents the argument at index 1.

 02:13
'while' condition will decrement the number of arguments.

 02:18
This statement will print all the arguments passed to the program.

 02:23
At the end, we have return 0 statement.

 02:27
Let us open the terminal by pressing Ctrl+Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

 02:35
Type: gcc space main hyphen with hyphen args.c space hyphen o space args. Press Enter.

 02:49
Type: dot slash args. Press Enter.

 02:54
You can see the output as:
"Total number of arguments are 1"
"The first argument is null"
"arguments are ./args"

 03:06
Command line arguments  are given during execution.

 03:11
Total number of arguments are 1 as the zeroth argument is the executable filename itself.

 03:19
The first argument is null as we have not passed any argument to the program.

 03:26
Argument is only one i.e. dot slash args.

 03:31
Now let us execute again.

 03:34
Press the up-arrow key space type: Sunday space Monday space Tuesday. Press Enter.

 03:47
Now we can see the output:
Total number of arguments are 4 
The first argument is Sunday 
Arguments are ./args  Sunday Monday  and Tuesday .

 04:04
Let me explain the output.

 04:06
Total number of arguments are 4 as- ./args, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.

 04:14
The first argument is Sunday.

 04:17
The zeroth argument always gives executable file-name.

 04:22
Sunday is assigned to first argument.

 04:25
Monday is assigned to second argument.

 04:28
Tuesday is assigned to third argument.

 04:31
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.

 04:37
In this tutorial, we learnt:
 Command line arguments
 argc
 argv.


 04:45
As an assignment, execute the program with different arguments.
