 Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Inserting Text in Drawings in LibreOffice Draw.

00:07
In this tutorial, we will learn how to:

00:10
* Work with text in drawings

00:12
* Format text in drawings and

00:15
* Work with text boxes.

00:17
 We will also learn to:

00:19
* Set indents, space and align text

00:22
* Add text to Lines and Arrows

00:26
* Place  text within Callouts.

00:29
Text can be added in two ways:

00:31
* It can be directly inserted into a drawn object,

00:35
including on lines and arrows.

00:37
* It can be inserted into a text box as an independent Draw object.

00:42
Here, we are using:

00:44
* Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 and
 LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.


00:52
 Let us open the Draw file “Water Cycle” and add some text to it.

00:57
 We shall add the text “Cloud Formation” to the two white clouds, next to the sun.

01:04
 Select the white cloud group.

01:06
Double-click on it in order to enter the group.

01:10
 Let us select the top cloud.

01:13
Now, let’s select the Text tool from the Drawing toolbar.

01:17
 Can you see the cursor has transformed into a small, vertical, blinking line?

01:23
This is the text cursor.

01:25
 Let us type the text: “Cloud Formation”.

01:29
 Now, click anywhere on the page.

01:33
 Let us enter the same text for the other white cloud too.

01:37
 To exit the group, double-click anywhere on the page.

01:42
 Let us now name the sun in the same way.

01:45
 Entering text in objects cannot get simpler than this!

01:50
 Next, let us select the gray cloud group.

 01:53
As before, double-click on it to enter the group.

01:57
 Type “Rain Cloud” in each cloud.

02:02
 As the text in the gray clouds is black in color, it is not visible.

02:07
So, let us change the color of the text to white.

02:11
 Select the text and right-click for the context menu and select Character.

02:17
 The “Character” dialog-box is displayed.

02:20
Click on the Font Effects tab.

02:23
 In the Font color field, scroll down and select White.

02:28
Click OK.

02:30
The font color changes to white.

02:33
 In the same manner, let’s change the text color of the second cloud.

02:38
Select the text and right-click, then select Character.

02:43
 In Font color, choose “White”.

02:46
 Double-click anywhere on the page to exit the group.

02:50
 Similarly, let’s type the word “Mountain” in the triangle that depicts the mountain.

02:58
 You can format text for

02:59
Character, that is, change font styles and give special effects to fonts.

03:05
 You can also format text for Paragraph, that is, align text, set indents or spacing and set tab positions.

03:13
 You can access these dialog-boxes either

03:16
from the Context menu or

03:18
from the Main menu.

03:21
 To access the Character dialog-box from the Main menu, select Format and select Character.

03:28
 To access the Paragraph dialog-box from the Main menu, select Format and select Paragraph.

03:36
 In the rectangle, let’s draw a thick black line to show where the ground water accumulates.

03:43
 From the Drawing tool bar, select Line.

03:46
Move the cursor to the page, press the left mouse-button and drag from left to right.

03:54
Draw a horizontal line that will divide the rectangle into two equal halves.

04:01
The ground is divided into two!

 04:04
 Now, let’s make the line wider.

04:07
Select the line and right-click for the context menu.

04:11
Click on Line. The “Line” dialog-box appears.

04:16
 In the Style field, click the drop-down box.

04:39
 First, let’s select the Text tool.

04:42
This is the capital “T” option on the Drawing toolbar.

04:46
Move to the Draw page.

04:49
Now, the cursor has been transformed into a Plus sign with a small capital 'I' beneath it.

04:55
 Click inside the rectangle.

04:57
Observe that a text-box appears.

05:01
Here, let's type: “Ground water table”.

05:05
 To  align the text to the centre of the text-box, place the cursor inside the text box.

05:12
Click on Centered icon, in the Standard toolbar, at the top.

05:19
 In a similar manner, let’s add the text:

05:22
“Rain water flows from land into rivers and sea”, in the triangle.

05:30
 Pause this tutorial for the assignment.

05:33
 Draw a square.

05:35
 Insert the text: “This is a square.

05:38
A square has four equal sides and four equal angles. Each angle in a square is ninety degrees.

05:46
 The square is a quadrilateral.”

05:54
 Apply the font size, style and alignment options to the text.

06:00
 Now let’s arrange the arrows in the diagram.

06:03
These arrows show evaporation of water from land, vegetation and water bodies to the clouds.

06:12
 Let’s select the left-most arrow.

06:14
Now, click and drag towards the mountain.

06:18
 Let’s select the middle arrow.

06:21
Now, click and drag towards the trees.

06:25
 The third arrow  shows evaporation of water from water to the clouds.

06:31
 Let’s use the option Curve to draw a line that shows water running down the mountains.

 From the Drawing toolbar, click on  Curve and select Freeform Line.

06:43
 On the draw page, place the cursor next to the mountain.

06:47
Press the left mouse button and drag down.

06:51
You have drawn a curved line!

06:53
 Now, let’s add descriptions to each of these arrows.

06:58
 Select the first arrow to the right and simply type: “Evaporation from rivers and seas”.

07:06
Click anywhere on the page.

07:08
The text appears on the line.

07:12
 Notice that the text is placed exactly on the line and hence it is not clear.

07:18
 To move the text above the line, click on the line.

07:22
 Text is placed horizontally.

07:25
 Place the cursor at the end of the text and press the Enter key.

07:30
Click on the page.

07:32
The text gets aligned.

07:35
 Text typed on lines and arrows can also be formatted using options from the context menu.

07:41
 Let’s format the font size using the context menu.

07:45
 Click on the text:

07:47
“Evaporation from rivers and seas”.

07:50
The text is now horizontal.

07:53
 Let’s select the text and right-click to view the context menu.

07:58
Select Size and click 22.

08:02
The size of the font has changed.

08:05
 Now, let’s type the following text for all the other arrows.

08:09
"Evaporation from soil"

08:12
"Evaporation from vegetation"

08:17
"Run off water from the mountains".

08:22
 Let’s show rain falling from the grey clouds.

08:26
 To show rain- let’s draw dotted arrows which point downwards from the cloud.

08:32
From the Drawing toolbar, select Line Ends with Arrow.

08:37
 Then place the cursor on the first grey cloud to the left.

08:42
Press the left mouse button and drag it down.

08:46
 Right-click for the context menu and click Line.

08:50
The “Line” dialog-box appears.

08:53

08:56
2 dots 1 dash.

08:58
Click OK.

09:00
We have drawn a dotted arrow.

09:02
 Let’s copy and paste two more arrows for this cloud.

09:06
 Now, let’s copy and paste two arrows to the other cloud.

09:12
 Now, let’s add the text “Rain” to the dotted arrows.

09:21
 Let’s type the text “Evaporation to form the clouds”, in a text box, just above the Water object.

 09:28
From the Drawing toolbar, select the Text tool and draw a text-box as shown.

09:35
Type: “Evaporation to form the clouds” inside it.

09:41
 From the Drawing toolbar, select the Text Tool

09:53
 Move the text-box by first clicking on the border of the text-box.

09:57
Now, drag and drop it in the desired location.

10:02
 Following the previous steps, let’s give the title “WaterCycle Diagram”

10:07
using a text-box and format the text in Bold.

10:16
 We have completed drawing the 'Water Cycle' diagram!

10:20
 Now, let’s learn about Callouts.

10:22
What are Callouts?

10:24
 They are special text-boxes that call your attention to or

10:29
 point to an object or a location in the Draw page.

10:33
Most comic books, for example, have

10:36
text placed inside Callouts.

10:39
 Let’s add a new page to the Draw file.

10:42
From Main menu, select Insert and click on Slide.

10:47
A new page is inserted.

10:50
 To draw a Callout, go to the Drawing toolbar.

10:54
 Click the small black triangle, next to the Callout icon.
