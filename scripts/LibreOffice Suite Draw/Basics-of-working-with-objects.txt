 Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Basics of Working with Objects in LibreOffice Draw.

 00:08
In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

00:11
* Cut, copy, paste objects

00:14
* Re-size objects dynamically using handles

00:17
* Arrange Objects

00:19
* Group and ungroup objects

00:21
* Edit individual objects in a group

00:24
* Move objects within a group.

00:28
Here, we are using:
 Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 and
 LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.


00:37
 Let us open the “WaterCycle” file which we had saved on the Desktop.

00:42
 Now, let’s copy and paste three more clouds to this picture.

00:47
 First, select the cloud. Then right-click to view the  context menu and click Copy.

00:54
Then, place the cursor on the page, right-click for the context menu again and click Paste.

01:02
 But we can see only one cloud!

01:05
Where is the cloud that we copied and pasted?

01:08
The copied cloud has been pasted on the top of the original cloud!

01:13
 Let us select the cloud and move it to the left.

01:17
 Let us create one more cloud in the same manner.

01:21
 Select the cloud, right-click for the context menu and click Copy.

01:26
Right-click again for the context menu and click Paste.

01:30
 Now, select the copied cloud and move it to the left.

01:37
 We can also use short-cut keys to make copies of objects-

01:41
* Ctrl+C to copy an object

01:44
* Ctrl+V to paste an object

01:47
* Ctrl+X to cut an object.

01:50
 Select the cloud and press the Ctrl and 'C' keys together.

01:55
 The cloud has been copied.

01:57
 To paste, press Ctrl and 'V' keys together.

02:02
 Now, select the cloud and move it to the desired location.

02:08
 Pause this tutorial and do this assignment.

02:11
 Add two pages to your draw file.

02:14
 Draw two objects on page one.

02:18
 Copy an object from page one to page two.

02:22
 Check where the copied object is placed.

02:25
 Cut an object and paste it. You can use the short-cut keys for this purpose.

02:31
 Check if a copy of the object is made when you cut it.

02:36
 Let us reduce the size of this cloud.

02:38
 So, first select it.

 02:40
 Now the handles are visible.

 02:43
 Next, place the cursor on one of the corner handles till arrowhead is visible.

02:50
 Now, hold the left mouse button and drag the arrow inward to make the cloud smaller.

02:57
 To enlarge it, drag the arrow outward.

03:00
 To  make this arrow longer, first select it.

 03:04
 Now, move the cursor over one of the handles.

03:07
 A small transparent arrow with a square beneath appears at the cursor tip.

03:14
 Now, press the Shift key on the keyboard, hold the left mouse button and using the arrow’s handle, drag it down.

03:25
 It is much easier to re-size the object if you press the Shift key also, isn’t it?

03:32
 Resizing using the handles of an object is called Dynamic Resizing.

03:38
 This means, we do not use exact measurements.

03:42
 We will learn to exactly re-size objects in later tutorials.

03:47
 In a similar manner, let’s increase the width of this rectangle.

03:52
 Select the rectangle, press the Shift key on the keyboard and drag it upward.

03:59
 Look at the Status bar, at the bottom of the Draw window.

04:03
 Note that when we resize the rectangle again, the dimensions change.

04:09
 The Status bar shows the change in position and dimension of the object.

04:16
 Now let’s arrange the clouds and the sun as shown here.

04:20
 To identify the clouds, let’s number them- 1, 2, 3, 4, starting from the left to right.

 04:29
 To insert the numbers- let’s select this cloud, double-click and type '1'.

04:36
 Similarly, let's number the other clouds too.

04:44
 Now, let’s select cloud 4 and place it over the  sun.

 04:49
 To send it behind the sun,  right-click on the cloud for the context menu.

04:55
 Click Arrange and select Send Backward.

04:58
 Cloud 4 is now behind the sun.

05:02
 Send Backward sends an object one layer behind the present one.

05:07
 Now, let’s select cloud 3 and place it above the sun.

05:12
 Right-click for the context menu, click Arrange and select Send to Back.

05:18
 Cloud 3 is now behind both the sun and cloud 4.

 05:23
 Send to Back sends an object to the last layer.

 05:28
 It now becomes simple to arrange the clouds as shown in the slide.

05:32
 Let’s select cloud 4, right-click for context menu, click Arrange and select Bring to Front.

05:40
 Bring to Front brings an object to the first layer.

 05:44
 Then select cloud 3, right-click for context menu, click Arrange and select Bring Forward.

 05:52
 Bring Forward brings an object one layer ahead.

05:57
 Now, select cloud 2 and place it on cloud 1.

 06:01
 The clouds are arranged as shown in the slide.

 06:07
 Next, let’s delete the numbers from the clouds.

06:10
 To do so, select the cloud and double-click. Then select the number and press the Delete key on the keyboard.

06:23
 Pause the tutorial here for this assignment.

06:26
Draw a circle, a square and a star and place them as shown below.

06:32
Select each object and apply each option from the Arrange menu.

06:38
Check how the placement of  figures change for each option.

 06:44
Now, place the object as shown on this slides and check the Bring to Front  and Sent to Back options.

06:53
Next, let’s add trees- like the ones shown in this slide, to the 'Water Cycle' diagram.

 06:59
 We shall draw a tree using the block arrow and an explosion.

 07:05
 Let us add a new page to this Draw file by clicking on Insert and then on Slide.

07:11
 This will add a new page to our file.

07:15
 To draw the trunk of the tree, from the Drawing toolbar, select Block Arrows.

07:21
 Click on the small black triangle to see the available shapes and select Split Arrow.

 07:28
 Place the cursor on the page, hold the left mouse button and drag downwards and sideways.

 07:35
 You have drawn a tree trunk with two branches!

07:39
 Let us add leaves to the branch.

 07:42
 Select Stars from the Drawing toolbar.

07:45
 Then, click on the small black triangle and select Explosion.

 07:51
 Now, move to the draw page, place the cursor on the left branch of the arrow, hold the left mouse button and drag left to draw the shape.

08:01
 So, we have added leaves to the tree!

 08:04
 We shall copy this shape to the right branch of the tree also.

08:09
 Select the shape.

08:11
 On the keyboard, press the Ctrl+C keys to copy.

08:15
 Then, press Ctrl+V keys to paste.

08:19
Now move the shape to the right branch of the tree.

08:22
 We have drawn a tree!

08:25
 Let us select the tree and move it down.

08:28
 Only the tree trunk moves down; the leaves don’t!

08:32
 Here, the tree trunk and the two leaves are treated as separate objects.

08:38
 Let’s move the tree trunk back to where it was.

08:41
 Let us learn how to group the tree trunk and two leaves into a single unit.

08:47
Any change made to a group is applied to all the objects within the group.

 08:53
 First, click on the page so that none of the objects are selected.

 08:58
 Then, from the Drawing toolbar, click Select.

09:02
 Move the cursor to the page and click on the page.

09:05
 Now, press the left mouse button and drag so that all the objects are selected.

09:11
 You will see a dotted rectangle.

09:14
 Ensure all the objects of  the tree are selected within this rectangle.

 09:20
 Alternately, you can select two or more objects by pressing the Shift key and then clicking on each object.

 09:28
 Right-click for context menu and select Group.

09:32
 Now, click on any object in the tree.

 09:36
 The handles appear as if they are part of a single object.

09:40
 These objects are now treated as a single unit.

09:45
 To ungroup them as separate objects, select the tree, right-click and select Ungroup.

 09:52
 The objects are now ungrouped and are treated as three separate objects.

 09:56
 Let’s group them again.

09:58
Press the Shift key and select the object one after another.

10:03
Right-click and select Group.

10:06
Let's copy the tree to page one which is our main drawing page.

10:10
 So, Ctrl and C to copy,  click on page one and Ctrl and 'V' to paste.

10:17
 Now, suppose we want to edit a single object within a group. What do we do?

 10:23
 Let me demonstrate a simple way to do this without having to ungroup and regroup the objects.

10:30
 Select the group and right-click for the context menu.

 10:33
 Select Enter Group.

 10:35
 Notice that all the objects outside the group are disabled.

 10:39
 Only the objects within the group can be edited.

10:43
 For example, let us select the leaves on the right-side of the tree and reduce the size.

10:51
 Let us press Ctrl + 'Z' to undo this and proceed further.

10:56
 Now, we should reduce the size of  the tree so that it fits in the 'Water Cycle' drawing.

 11:02
 So, we have to exit the Edit mode of the group.

11:05
 To exit the group, place the cursor on the page, right-click and select Exit group.

11:13
 We are now out of the Edit mode for the group.

11:16
 Select the tree and move the cursor over the bottom-right handle.

 11:21
 The cursor turns into a re-sizing arrow.

 11:24
 Drag the arrow inwards.

11:26
 And we have reduced the size of the whole tree!

11:29
 Let's add three more trees to this picture.

11:32
 Select the tree and Ctrl and 'C' to copy, Ctrl and 'V' three times to paste.

11:39
This will create three copies of the trees.

 11:41
 Now, we will move them to the desired location.

11:45
 Repeat these steps for all the trees.

 11:51
 Now remember, each tree is made up of three objects.

 11:55
 Each tree is also a group by itself.

 11:58
 We have created groups of objects.

12:01
 Let us now add the water body to the drawing.

12:04
 To give the effect of water, we shall add a triangle next to the rectangle and then add a curve.

12:12
 To draw a triangle, select Basic shapes from the Drawing toolbar.

 12:18
 Click on the small black triangle and select Right Triangle.

12:24
 Let us draw it and place it next to the rectangle.

12:28
 Now, let us draw a curve filled with color to show the movement of water.

12:34
 From the Drawing toolbar, select Curve. Now, click on Freeform Line, Filled.

12:42
 Then place the cursor on top of the triangle, hold the left mouse button and drag it down.

12:49
 Let’s adjust the curve so that it looks like flowing water.

12:56
 The triangle and the curve together create water; let’s group them as a single object.

13:03
 From the Drawing toolbar, click Select.

 13:07
 Now, move the cursor to the page, press the left mouse button and drag to cover the triangle and the curve.

13:16
 Right-click and select Group.

 13:18
 We have now created the basic outline of the  'Water Cycle'.

 13:23
 Here is another assignment for you.

13:26
