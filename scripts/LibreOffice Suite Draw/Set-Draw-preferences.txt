 Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial about Setting Preferences in LibreOffice Draw.

00:06
In this tutorial, you will learn how to set the following preferences:
 Properties
 Create Versions
 View in color/grayscale/black-and-white.


00:18
Here, we are using:
 Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 as our operating system and
 LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.


00:29
Let us open the file "3D ObjectsChart" that we had saved earlier. And go to page 1.

 00:40
Suppose we want to add descriptions to this file for later reference.

00:45
To do so, from the Main menu, select File and click  Properties.

00:50
You will see the Properties dialog-box.

00:56
Click the General tab. All the information that is relevant to the file is listed here.

 01:02
Please note:  we can only view the file details here. You cannot make any changes.

01:09
Next, click on the Description tab.

01:13
Here, we can enter the Title, Subject, Keywords and Comments as per your requirement.

01:20
This information can be used as reference later.

01:25
In the Title field, let us type: "3D Objects Chart".

01:30
In the Subject field, we will type: "3D Objects Comparisons".

01:37
In Keywords, we’ll type: "3D and 3D Effects".

01:42
Finally, in the Comments field, let us type: "Learning about File Properties".

 01:48
It is a good practice to type information that is relevant to the Draw file.

01:54
In addition to the properties present in the Description tab, you may want to set your own properties.

02:00
For example, you may want to know: the date on which the document was prepared,

02:05
the editor of the document,

02:07
the client for whom the document was prepared etc.

02:11
Draw has the features that help you customize this information.

02:17
In the Properties dialog-box, click Custom Properties.


02:23
Here, you will see three fields: Name, Type and Value.

02:30
Let’s click the Add button at the bottom-right.

02:33
You will now see drop-down boxes under each field.

02:40
Let us click on the Name drop-down and select the option Date Completed.

02:46
In the Type drop-down, we will select Date Time.

02:51
The Value field, will now indicate date and time.

02:55
Let us not change the date.

02:57
In the Time field, let us enter 10:30:33.

03:05
Now you know the date on which the document was prepared.

03:09
Let us add another field now. Click Add.

03:14
You will see a second list of drop-down boxes.

03:21
In the Name drop-down, let us select Checked by.

03:25
For the Type field, let us select Text.

03:29
In Value, type the text “ABC”.

03:33
Click OK. That’s how you add your own properties to a Draw file.

 03:39
Now, let’s learn how to delete a property that we created.

03:44
Go to the Main menu, click on File and select Properties.

03:51
In the Properties dialog-box, click Custom Properties.

03:55
Let us delete the first property Checked by.

04:01
Click the Remove Property button on the right. The property is deleted.

04:07
Click OK.

04:11
You can save multiple versions of the Draw file too!
This feature is called Versions.

04:17
For example, You may add objects on the first day and save it.

04:22
The next day you may modify the drawing.

04:24
You may want to have a copy of both the original drawing and the modified drawing.

04:31
Let us save the file using the Versions option.

04:33
From the Main menu, go to File and click Versions.

 04:39
You will see the Versions dialog-box.

 04:42
Click on the Save New Version button.

04:47
You will see the Insert Version Comment dialog-box.

04:51
Let’s type the comment "Version One".

04:55
Click on OK and then click on Close.

05:00
Now, let us change the text in the title- "Geometry in Two D Shapes and Three D Shapes".

05:07
Let’s change the colour of the text to blue.

 05:18
Let us save the file using the Versions option.

05:22
From the Main menu, go to File and click on Versions.

05:26
Click on the Save New Version button.

05:30
The Insert Version Comment dialog appears.

05:34
Type the comment "Version Two".

05:36
Click OK.

05:40
There are now two versions listed here  - "Version One" and "Version Two".

05:46
We know that Version One is the file with the black coloured title font.

05:51
And Version Two is the file with the blue coloured title font.

05:54
Let us select Version One and click on Open.

06:00
We can see the version with the black coloured title font.

 06:05
You can enable automatic saving of versions, every time you close a Draw file.

06:11
To do so, click on File and then click on Versions.

06:15
Now, a check-box option  says "Always save a version on closing".

06:23
Check this box.

06:24
This will ensure that every time you close the Draw file, a new version will be saved. Click Close.

06:34
You can also set the viewing preferences for your Draw file.

06:38
You can view your drawing in Color, Gray scale or Black and White.

06:44
By default, we view the Draw file in colour.

06:48
Let us change the view to Gray Scale.

06:53
Click on View, click Color/Grayscale and select Gray Scale.

 06:59
You will see that the objects are now displayed in grey.

 07:03
Now, let’s change the view to Black and White.

07:08
From the Main Menu, select View, click Color/Grayscale and select Black and White.

 07:17
You will see that the objects are now displayed in black-and-white.

 07:25
You can switch the view back to colour again.

07:29
To do so, click on View, click Color/Grayscale and select Color.

 07:36
The drawing is again displayed in colour.
