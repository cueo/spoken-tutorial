Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Creating Curves and Polygons in LibreOffice Draw.

00:07
 In this tutorial, you will learn how to work with Polygons and Curves in Draw.

00:14
 For this tutorial, you should have basic  knowledge of LibreOffice Draw. If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit this website.

00:25
 Here, we are using:
 Ubuntu Linux, version 10.04 and
 LibreOffice Suite, version 3.3.4.


00:34
What are polygons? The term poly means many. A many-sided figure is called a polygon.

00:43
We will learn how to a draw a map as shown in this slide. This map shows the route from the house to the school.

 00:53
At the end of this  tutorial, you will be able to create a similar diagram by yourself.

01:00
Let us switch to Draw. I have named this file as "RouteMap" and saved it on the Desktop.

01:09
First of all, let us enable the Grid view. To do so, click on View, select Grid and choose Display Grid.

 01:19
Before we begin drawing, let us set the Page margins and the Page orientation.

01:26
Place the cursor on the Draw page and right-click for the Context menu.

01:33
Select Page and click Page Setup.

01:36
The Page Setup dialog-box appears.

01:40
Click on the Format drop-down and select A4. Select Orientation as Portrait.

01:49
The Left, Right, Top and Bottom margins are set to 1. Click OK.

 01:57
Let us set the default font size to 24.

02:02
From the Main menu, select Format and Character.

02:06
The Character dialog-box appears.

02:10
Click the Font tab and in the Size field, scroll down and select 24. Click OK.

 02:18
This will ensure that the text we type inside the shapes are clearly visible.

02:24
Now, let us begin by drawing the house.

02:28
 Let’s insert a square to show the house and type "Home" inside it.

 02:37
Next, let’s draw the park to the right of the house.

02:42
The park is an odd-shaped rectangle; the width on the left side is greater than the right side.

02:51
Let’s use a polygon to represent it. To draw a polygon, go to the Drawing toolbar.

02:58
Click on Curve and then click on the small black arrow next to the icon.

03:04
Now, select Polygon filled.

03:08
Place the cursor on the Draw page. Hold the left mouse button and drag the cursor down. Release the mouse button.

03:18
We have drawn a straight line. Drag the mouse to the right until the shape is that of a right triangle.

03:26
Click the left mouse button and drag the mouse upward. Now, double-click the left mouse button.

 03:35
You have drawn a polygon. Let’s type "Park" inside it.

03:41
Next to the Park, there is a Commercial Complex. This too is an odd-shaped polygon. Let’s draw it!

03:50
Go to the Drawing toolbar. Click on the small black arrow next to the Curve icon and click on Polygon filled.

04:00
Place the cursor on the Draw page. Hold the left mouse button and drag it down.

04:07
Now, release the mouse button. You see a straight line. Move the mouse to the left until the shape is that of a triangle.

04:19
Click the left mouse-button and drag the mouse upward. Now, hold down the Shift key and drag the cursor inwards.

04:31
Double-click the left mouse-button.

 04:35
You have drawn yet another polygon. Let us type the text "Commercial Complex" inside it.

04:45
Following the previous steps, let's draw a parking lot. From the Drawing toolbar, let’s select Polygon filled. And then place the cursor on the Draw page and draw the polygon.

05:02
Now, let us type the text "Parking Lot" inside it.

 05:08
Remember, you can draw a polygon with as many sides as you want.

05:14
Pause this tutorial and try this assignment. Draw five-sided, six-sided and ten-sided polygons.

05:23
A Residential Complex is right next to the house and is rectangular in shape.

05:30
From the Drawing toolbar, select Rectangle.

05:35
Then, place the mouse on the Draw page and drag to draw a rectangle.

05:41
We will name it "Residential Complex".

05:45
There is also a Play Ground in this locality. This is in the shape of a really long rectangle.

05:53
From the Drawing toolbar, select Polygon 45 degree Filled.

05:59
Place the cursor on the Draw page. Click and drag the left mouse-button down and release it.

06:07
Click and move the mouse to the right and release it. Now, click and drag the mouse upward to complete the rectangle.

06:17
Double-click the left mouse-button.

 06:21
You have drawn yet another polygon!

06:25
Let us type the text "Play Ground" inside it.

06:30
Now, let’s draw the Lake next to the playground.

06:35
From the Drawing toolbar, select  Freeform Line filled.

06:40
In the Draw page, press the left mouse-button and rotate the mouse in an anti-clockwise direction. Release the left mouse-button.

 06:52
We have drawn a lake. Let’s type "Lake" inside it.

06:58
The last building in this area is the School.' The School campus is also in the form of a polygon.

07:07
Let’s draw this on our map now. Again from the Drawing toolbar, let us select Polygon 45 degree filled.

07:17
Next, let us place the cursor on the Draw page and draw the polygon. Finally, let’s double-click the mouse when the polygon has been completed.

07:28
Let’s type "School Campus" inside it.

07:34
Let’s insert a text-box and type the text "School Main Gates" inside it.

 07:44
Let’s rotate the text-box and place it in the correct position.

07:48
Now, from the Main menu, select Modify and click Rotate.

07:54
Notice that the handles change to the color red. This implies that we are in the Rotate mode.

08:02
Can you see the small arc with arrows on either side? We use this to rotate the box.

08:09
Let’s place the cursor over the last handle on the top right corner of the text-box.

08:17
The Rotation curve appears.

08:21
Press the left mouse-button. Drag the curve in a clock-wise direction until it is placed in the correct position.

08:30
Now, click anywhere on the Draw page to exit the 'Rotate' mode.

08:36
Let’s also show the side entrance to the school.

08:41
Like in the previous step, let’s draw a text-box, enter the text "School Side Entrance" inside it.

08:50
Now, let’s draw directions using arrows. From the house, we have to turn right.

08:57
From the Drawing toolbar, let’s select Line Ends with Arrow.

09:02
Let’s move to the Draw page and draw the line.

09:08
Then walk past the Residential Complex and take a left.

09:14
Let’s draw another line to show this route.

09:19
Then, next to the Play Ground take the right, walk down.

09:25
Then take a right again to reach the School’s main gate.

 09:32
We have drawn our first route. You would have noticed that two types of curves and polygons can be drawn.

09:41
One is using the Filled option and the other is without a fill. When you use the Filled option, the curve is filled with color.

09:52
You would have also noticed that each of the options in the Curve toolbar has a different method of mouse operation to draw the curve.

10:02
Here is an assignment for you. Draw curves and polygons using all the options in the Curve toolbar.

10:10
Notice, how the shape of the cursor and the mouse operations change with each selection of the curve or the polygon.

10:20
Check if you can change the fill color in the option Filled.
