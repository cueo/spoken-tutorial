Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Import and Export Images in LibreOffice Draw.

00:06
 In this tutorial, you will learn to import images into a Draw page and to save a Draw file into various file formats.

 00:16
We can import and export both vector and bitmap or raster images in Draw.

00:23
Here, we are using:
 Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 and 
 LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.


00:32
Let us open the file 'RouteMap'.

00:35
For the purpose of this tutorial, a 'JPEG' file of the 'WaterCycle' drawing has already been created and saved on the Desktop.

 00:46
Let us import this image into our Draw file.

00:49
Let’s close this image.

 00:52
First, select the page where you want to import the picture.

00:57
Let’s insert a new page and select it.

01:01
To import vector or bitmap images, click on the Insert tab and select Picture.

01:08
Then click From File.

01:10
The Insert picture dialog-box appears.

01:14
Let us now select 'Water Cycle.jpeg.'

00:17
If we click on Open, the image will be embedded physically into our Draw file.

01:24
If we check the Link box here, then the image will be linked by the path.

01:29
Let us click on Open.

01:32
A message appears saying that the image will only be stored as a link.

01:37
Click  Keep Link.

 01:40
The picture is inserted as a link in the Draw file.

 01:44
Links can also be removed easily.

01:48
Go to the Main menu, select Edit and then click Link.

01:53
The Edit Links dialog-box appears.

01:57
This dialog-box lists all the links in the Draw file.

02:02
Click on the link for the picture 'WaterCycle'.

02:06
Click Break Link.

02:09
Draw will display a confirmation message. Click Yes.

02:14
The link is removed. Now, click on the Close button.

 02:20
But, you will notice that the picture is still present in the file.

02:25
When you break a link, the picture is automatically embedded in the Draw file.

02:31
Let’s delete this picture now. Select the picture and press the Delete button.

02:39
Here is an assignment for you.

02:42
Create two Draw files.

02:44
Insert an image in one file and save it.

02:48
Embed an image in another file and save it.

02:52
Compare both the file sizes.

02:55
In the file in which you linked the image, change the size of the image.

03:00
Check if the change is reflected in the original file.

 03:05
Next, let’s import the 'WaterCycle' diagram directly into this file as a Draw image.

03:13
From the Main menu, click Insert and select File.

03:18
The  Insert File dialog-box opens.

03:21
From the list, select the Draw file "WaterCycle.odg".

03:28
Click Open.

03:30
The Insert slides/objects dialog-box appears.

03:34
Click on the plus sign next to the file path.

03:38
You will see a list of the slides.

03:41
Let us select slide one with the 'WaterCycle' diagram.

 03:46
You can also insert the page or the object as a link.

03:51
To do this, simply click the  Link check-box.

03:55
Click OK.

03:57
A confirmation dialog-box appears, asking if the objects should be fit to the new format.

04:05
Click Yes.

 04:07
The slide is inserted into the file, in a new page.

 04:12
Next, we shall learn to export images from Draw.

04:17
Exporting a file in 'Draw' means- to convert a 'Draw' file or a page of the Draw file or an object in a Draw file to a different file format.

04:29
For example, the 'Draw' file can be converted to a 'PDF', 'HTML', 'JPEG' or a bitmap file.

04:39
The file formats PDF, Flash and HTML  always export the whole 'Draw' file.

04:47
Let’s minimize the 'RouteMap' file.

04:51
Do you wonder how we converted the 'Draw' 'WaterCycle' diagram to the 'JPEG' format?

04:58
Let me demonstrate how it was done.

05:01
Open the file 'WaterCycle.'

05:05
Then, from the Pages panel, select the page with the 'WaterCycle' diagram.

05:11
From the Main menu, click File and select Export.

05:16
The  Export dialog-box appears.

05:18
Let us enter the name "WaterCycleDiagram" in Filename field.

05:24
From the Places panel, browse and select Desktop.

05:29
In the File type field, we will select the option  JPEG. But you can save the 'Draw' file in any format you want.

05:38
Check the Selection check-box.

05:42
Click Save.

 05:43
The JPEG Options dialog-box appears.

05:47
Let’s keep the default options that are selected in this dialog-box.

05:53
Click OK.

05:55
The Draw page with the 'WaterCycle' diagram is saved as a 'JPEG' on the Desktop.

 06:02
Here, only one page from the 'Draw' file is converted to 'JPEG' file.

 06:08
If you save in PDF, Flash or HTML formats then all the pages in the 'Draw' file will be exported.

 06:18
We can also edit raster images in 'Draw'.

06:22
Raster images can be formatted using the Format menu.

06:26
You can also use the Picture toolbar to edit these pictures.

06:31
This brings us to the end of the tutorial on LibreOffice Draw.

06:37
In this tutorial, you have learnt to import and export images and to save Draw objects into various file formats.

06:47
Here is an assignment for you.

06:50
Individual objects or a group of selected objects can also be exported.

06:56
Convert only the clouds and the mountain from the 'WaterCycle' Draw file into  'JPEG' format.
