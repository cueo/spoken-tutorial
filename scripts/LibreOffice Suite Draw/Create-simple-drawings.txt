Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on how to create Simple Drawings in LibreOffice Draw.

00:08
In this tutorial, you will learn how to create simple drawings using:

00:13

 Basic shapes such as lines, arrows and rectangles. 


00:17

 Basic geometric shapes, symbols, stars and banners.


00:22
You will also learn how to: Select, move and delete an object.

00:27

 Use the ruler to set margins and the align toolbar to position objects.


00:33
Here, we are using:
 Ubuntu Linux' version 10.04 and 
 LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.


00:42
Let us define the word Object.

00:44
The term “Object” denotes shapes or group of shapes used in Draw such as lines, squares, arrows, flowcharts and so on.

00:55
All the shapes shown in this slide are referred to as objects.

00:59
 Let us open the file “WaterCycle” that we have  saved on the Desktop.

01:04
We will first learn how to select an object.

01:08
Let’s say, we want to select the cloud. So, we will simply click on it.

01:13
On doing so, eight handles become visible.

01:16
Handles-
Handles are the small blue or green squares that appear on the sides of the selected object.

01:22
You will learn more about the handles and their use in the later tutorials.

01:27
Let’s add some more objects to our drawing.

01:30
Let us add a rectangle to represent the ground.

01:34
In the Drawing toolbar, click on Basic shapes and then click on Rectangle.

01:39
Now, move the cursor to the page. You will see a plus sign with a capital 'I'.

01:45
Hold the left mouse button and drag it to draw a rectangle.

01:50
Now, release the mouse button.

01:52
Next, let us draw some arrows to show the movement of water vapour from the ground to the cloud.

02:00
To draw a line, click on Line in the Drawing toolbar.

02:04
Move the cursor to the page.

02:06
You will see a plus sign with a slanting dash.

02:10
 Hold the left button of the mouse and drag from top to bottom.

02:15
You have drawn a straight line!

02:17
A line has two handles.

02:20
Now, let us add an arrowhead to the line.

02:23
We shall select the line now.

02:25
Right-click to view the context menu and click on Line.

02:30
You will see the “Line” dialog-box. Now, click on the Arrow styles tab and then click on the Arrow style drop-down.

02:39
This displays the available “Arrow styles”.

02:43
Select the first option named Arrow.

02:46
Click on OK.

02:48
This will add the selected style of arrowheads to both ends of the line.

02:52
But we need an arrowhead on only one end of the line.

02:57
So, first we will undo this change by pressing Ctrl+Z.

03:02
Right-click again to view the context-menu.

03:05
Now, click on the Line tab.

03:09
Here, under Arrow Styles, you will see the field named “Style”.

03:14
You see two drop-down boxes, one for each end of the line.

03:19
Click on the left drop-down box and select Arrow.

03:23
In the right drop-down box, select none.

03:26
Click on OK.

03:28
Note that an arrowhead has been added to the top end of the line.

03:33
We can also draw arrows using the “Lines and Arrows” option.

03:38
Let us draw two more arrows, next to this arrow.

03:42
From the Drawing toolbar >> click on Lines and Arrows and select Line Starts with Arrow.

03:48
Move the cursor to the Draw page.

03:51
Hold the left button of the mouse and drag from top to bottom.

03:56
It is easier to draw an arrow this way, is it not?

04:00
Let us add one more arrow in the same manner.

04:06
Pause this tutorial and do this assignment.

04:09
In your file “MyWaterCycle”, draw a line.

04:13
Select the line and open the Line dialog-box.

04:16
Under the Line Properties field, change style, color, width and transparency for lines.

04:24
Under the Arrow Styles field, change the arrow styles.

04:28
Next, let us draw a star.

04:31
Go to the Drawing toolbar and click on the small black triangle next to Stars.

04:37
Let us select 5 Point Star.

04:41
Now, place the cursor next to the cloud.

04:44
Hold the left button of the mouse and drag to the left.

04:48
You have drawn a star!

04:50
Now, let us learn how to move and delete objects.

04:54
To move an object, just select it and drag it to the desired location.

04:59
Now, release the mouse button.

05:02
You can also use the up, down and side arrow keys on the keyboard to move an object.

05:08
Moving objects is simple, isn't it?

05:11
To delete an object, just select it and then press the Delete key on the keyboard.

05:17
The object is deleted. Isn't it simple?

05:20
Now let us  learn about the basic aids - the Ruler and the Align toolbar.

05:26
The Ruler is used to set up page margins and modify the units of measurement.

05:31
The Align toolbar is used to position objects.

05:35
The Ruler is displayed on the top and on the left side of the Draw workspace.

05:40
To set the measurement units, right-click the Ruler on the top.

05:45
You will see a list of measurement units.

05:48
Click on Centimeter.

05:50
The measurement unit for the top ruler is now set to centimeter.

05:55
Similarly, let us set the measurement for the ruler on the left.

06:00
To make sure that the objects are drawn to scale, always set the same units of measurements for both rulers.

06:08
You will notice that the active ruler is in the color- white.

06:12
The ends of the ruler represent the page margin values that we set in Page Setup.

06:19
Let us see how the Ruler displays measurements for objects.

06:23
Select the cloud.

06:25
Can you see two small start and end marks on the ruler?

06:29
These define the edges of the cloud.

06:32
If you move these marks on the ruler, you will notice that the figure changes accordingly.

06:38
The ruler shows the size of an object on the page.

06:42
It also enables us to position an object on the page and displays page boundaries.

06:49
Let us move on to the next basic aid - Align toolbar.

06:53
We use the Align toolbar to align the selected object to the left, right, top, bottom and centre.

07:01
To enable the Align toolbar, go to the Main Menu and click View.

07:07
Under the View menu, click Toolbars.

07:11
You will see the list of toolbars.

07:13
Click Align.

07:15
You will see the Align toolbar.

07:18
Let us now see, how an object is aligned when we use different Align options.

07:24
Let us select the cloud.

07:26
On the Align toolbar, click Left.

07:29
The cloud is aligned to the left.

07:32
Let us now understand the difference between the two options Centered and Centre.

07:38
We shall align the circle to Centre and then to Centered.

07:43
First, let us align the circle to the Right.

07:47
Let’s select the circle and on the Align toolbar, click Right.

07:52
Now, on the Align toolbar, click Centre.

07:56
The circle is aligned to the centre position.

07:59
The option Centre centres the object exactly between the top and bottom margins of the page.

08:06
It does not move the object with respect to the page-width.

08:10
Now, from the Align toolbar, let us select Centered.

08:15
The circle is aligned to the centre of the page.

08:18
The option Centered aligns the circle to the centre of the page.

08:23
It moves the object with respect to the top and bottom margins and the page-width.

08:33
Now, we shall move the objects back to their correct positions as per our sample drawing.

08:40
Remember to save the file before you close it.

08:43
Here is another assignment for you.

08:46
In MyWaterCycle file, add a page.

08:50
Create these two figures.

08:53
Move them using the arrow keys.

08:55
Select any object you have drawn and delete it.

08:59
Use the ruler to measure the size of some the objects.

09:04
Then use the Align toolbar and align the objects to the centre of the page.

09:11
