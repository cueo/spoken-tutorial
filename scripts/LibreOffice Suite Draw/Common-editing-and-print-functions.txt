 Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Common Editing and Printing Functions in LibreOffice Draw.

00:08
 In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

00:10
* Set margins for the Draw page

00:13
* Insert page numbers, Date and time

00:16
* Undo and Redo actions

00:18
* Rename a page and

00:20
* Print a page.

00:22
 Here, we are using:
 Ubuntu Linux, version 10.04 and
  LibreOffice Suite, version 3.3.4.


00:33
 Let’s open the file 'WaterCycle' and select the page that has the 'WaterCycle' diagram.

00:40
 Let’s set Page Margins for this drawing.

00:44
 Why are Page Margins necessary?

00:46
Page Margins determine the space within which the objects will be placed inside a page.

00:53
For example, we may need to print the drawing and file it.

00:57
Margins ensure that there is adequate space on the sides

01:01
 so that a part of the figure is not cut or hidden when we print it.

01:07
 Let’s set Page Margins and then print the WaterCycle drawing.

01:11
 Let’s say the paper size that we use to print this diagram, is not the standard size.

01:18
 It has a width of 20 cms and a height of 20 cms.

01:23
It also requires a bottom margin of 1.5 cms.

01:29
 To set these measurements from the Main menu, select Format and click Page.

01:35
 The Page Setup dialog-box appears.

01:38
 Select the Page tab.

01:41
 In the Width field, enter the value “20” and in the Height field “20”.

01:47
Under Margins, in the Bottom field, enter '1.5'.

01:54
 To the right, you will see a preview of the Draw page.

01:58
This preview displays the changes made to the Draw page.

02:02
 Click OK.

02;04
 How does the drawing look?

02:06
It spills out of the page!

02:08
This also means that a part of the drawing will be lost when it is printed.

02:14
 You must ensure that:

02:15
* The drawings are always within the margins.

02:18
* When you draw, no part of the drawing spills out of the margin.

02:23
 Therefore, it is a good practice to set up the page margins before you begin your drawing.

02:29
 Again, from the Main menu, select Format and click Page.

02:35
 The Page Setup dialog-box appears.

02:38
 Click on the Page tab.

02:40
 Click the Format drop-down list and select "A4".

02:45
 This is the original margin that we had set.

02:48
 Click OK.

02:52
 The drawing is placed within the margins.

02:55
 You can also access the Page setup dialog-box from the Draw page

03:00
by right-clicking on the page and using the context  menu.

03:05
 Let’s click Cancel  and exit the dialog-box.

03:09
 Now, let us insert page numbers, date, time and the author’s name.

03:15
 Let us select the page with the WaterCycle  diagram and insert a page number.

03:21
 Go to the Main menu, select Insert and click Fields.

03:27
 The list of Fields is displayed.

03:31
 Fields  contain values that are automatically generated by Draw.


03:35
 We simply have to insert a Field  and the value generated by Draw.

03:41
 Let us click on Page number.

03:43
 A text-box with the number '1' is inserted on the Draw page.

03:48
 Let’s adjust the size of this text-box and make it a little smaller.

03:55
 Now, let us drag the box and place it at the bottom right corner of the page.

04:01
 To move the number box smoothly, select the number box and press the Shift key.

04:07
Now, let’s move it further down.

04:11
 Let’s check if the next number has been inserted on page two of this Draw file.

04:17
 It does not have a page number!

04:20
 The page number is inserted only in the page where we inserted the field!

04:26
 Now, let’s learn how to change the page number format.

04:30
 From the Main  menu, click on Format and select Page.

04:36
 The  Page Setup dialog-box appears.

04:39
 Click on the Page  tab.

04:41
 Under the Layout settings, select Format.

04:45
 From the drop-down list, select a, b, c.

04:49
Click OK.

04:52
 The page numbering has changed from 1, 2, 3 to a, b, c.

 04:58
Likewise, you can change it to any format.

05:01
 Let’s learn how to insert Date and Time fields.

05:05
 You can also insert Date and Time  stamps on your Draw page.

05:10
You can do so by clicking on Insert  and Fields.

05:14
 One is Date(fixed) and Time(fixed).

05:18
 The other is Date(variable) and Time(variable).

05:23
 The Date (fixed) and Time (fixed) options insert the current date and time.

05:29
These date and time values  will not be updated.

05:33
 The Date (variable) and the Time (variable) options, on the other hand,

05:37
are automatically updated as and when you open the file.

05:42
 Let’s insert the Time (variable) here.

05:46
 Now, let us drag the box and place it above the page number at the bottom right corner of the page.

05:56
 The time inserted will be updated to the current time whenever you open the Draw page.

06:03
 Let us now enter the name of the author who has created this file.

06:08
Here, we shall setup the author’s name on page one as- “Teacher A. B.”

06:17
 So, let’s go to Page one.

 06:19
 Go to the Main  menu, select Tools and click Options.

06:24
 The Options dialog-box appears.

06:27
 In the  Options dialog-box, click on LibreOffice and then click on  User Data.

06:34
 On the right hand side of the dialog-box, you can enter the user data information.

06:40
 You can enter the details here as per your requirements.

06:44
 In the "First/Last Name/Initials", let’s enter the text "Teacher", 'A', and 'B' respectively.

06:53
 Click OK.

06:55
 Now, from the  Main  menu, click  Insert, select Fields and click Author.

07:02
 The name Teacher A B is inserted in a text-box.

07:07
 Let’s drag this box and place it just above the Time field, at the bottom right corner of the Draw page.

07:15
 Now, what if we want to remove the fields we inserted, in the Draw page?

07:21
 Simply select the text-box and press Delete key.

07:25
 Let’s delete the field Author Name.

07:28
 And what if we want to undo this action?

07:31
 Simple.. you can undo any action by pressing Ctrl and 'Z' keys together.

07:38
 The action that was last executed, that is, the deletion of the Author field, is undone.

07:45
 The field is visible again.

07:48
 We can undo or redo actions from the Main menu too.

07:53
 From the Main menu, select  Edit and click Redo.

07:57
 The Author’s name is no longer visible!

08:00
 Let’s press the Ctrl+Z keys and undo all the field insertions we made.

08:06
 You can also use short-cut keys from the key board for the undo and redo commands.

08:13
 Press the Ctrl and Z keys together  to undo an action.

08:18
 Press the Ctrl and Y keys together to redo an action.

08:23
 Pause this tutorial and do this assignment.

08:26
 Change the Author’s name and Save it.

08:29
Now, add two more arrows to the page.

08:33
 Insert a page number and date on page two.

08:38
Now, undo and redo the last five actions.

08:42
 Check if the Undo and Redo options undo all the actions or if some actions cannot be undone.

08:51
 Let’s name this page “WaterCycleSlide”.

08:54
 Select the slide in the Pages pane, right-click and select Rename Page.

09:00
 The Rename Slide dialog-box appears.

09:03
 In the Name field, let us enter the name "WaterCycleSlide".

09:08
Click OK.

09:10
 Now, let’s place the cursor over this page.

09:14
Can you see the name “WaterCycleSlide” displayed here?

09:18
 It is a good practice to assign a name that is relevant to the page.

09:23
 Now, let’s set printing options and print the WaterCycle diagram.

 09:28
  In the Main menu, click File then click Print.

09:33
The Print dialog-box appears.

09:36
 To know about the settings under General and Options tabs,

09:41
 please see the tutorial on Viewing and printing Documents in the LibreOffice Writer series.

09:48
 On the left side, you will see the page preview area.

09:53
 The right side of the Print dialog-box comprises four tabs:

09:58
 General, LibreOffice Draw, Page Layout, Options.

10:04
 Let’s look at the options specific to LibreOffice Draw.

10:09
 Click on the LibreOffice Draw tab.

10:13
 Let’s check the boxes Page name and Date and Time.

10:17
This will print the page name, date and time along with the drawing.

10:23
 Let us select Original colors and Fit to printable page to print the drawing.

10:29
 Click on Print to print the 'WaterCycle' drawing from your computer.

10:34
 If you have configured your printer correctly then your drawing should begin printing now.
