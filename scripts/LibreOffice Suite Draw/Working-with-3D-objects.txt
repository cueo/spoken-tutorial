Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on  3D Objects in LibreOffice Draw.

00:05
In this tutorial, you will learn how to create 3D objects using the following options:
 Extrusion
 3D Toolbar
 3D Rotation Object. 


00:16
You will learn to edit and apply 3D effects to objects and create special effects using Duplication.

00:24
To use this tutorial, you must be familiar with Basic and Intermediate level tutorials in Draw.

00:30
Here, we are using:
 Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 as our operating system and
 LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.


00:40
Let’s create a geometry chart which shows a 2D shape and equivalent 3D form.
For example, a square is a 2D object, a cube is its 3D form.

00:53
We have a new Draw file here, named as "3DObjectsChart".

 00:59
Before we begin the drawing, let’s enable the grids and the guide lines. We have learnt about this in previous tutorials.

01:08
From the Main menu, click on View, select Grid and Display Grid.

01:17
Then again click on View, select Guides and Display Guides.

01:23
I want to set both the rulers to centimeters.

01:29
Place the mouse pointer on the horizontal ruler. Now, right-click and select Centimeter.

01:38
Place the mouse pointer on the vertical ruler. Again, right-click and select Centimeter.

01:45
Let us now draw a text-box on the top of the page.

01:49
Let’s insert the text: "Geometric shapes in 2D and 3D", inside it.

 01:55
Let us now divide the page into two vertical halves using a snap line.

02:01
Click on the vertical ruler and drag it to the Draw page.

02:05
A vertical dotted line appears.

02:08
Place the dotted line on the page such that the page is divided into two halves.

02:14
Let’s insert a text-box on the left side and type "2D Shapes" inside it.

02:23
Let’s draw another text-box on the right side and type "3D Shapes" inside it.

 02:30
Let us enable the 3D toolbars.

02:33
From the Main menu, click on  View, select Toolbars and 3D-Objects.

02:43
Again, click on View, select Toolbars and 3D-settings.

02:53
The 3D-Objects and 3D-Settings tool-boxes are displayed.

 03:02
We will first draw the 2D shapes.

03:05
We will draw a rectangle, a square, a circle and a triangle and place them one below the other.

03:14
The method of obtaining a 3D object, using a 2D object is called Extrusion.

03:19
Basically, the surface is moved outward to create the 3D object.

03:25
First, let us change the colour of the rectangle to "Turquoise 1".

03:31
Let’s make a copy of the rectangle.

03:35
Let’s drag the copied rectangle and place it on right half of the page.

03:40
Now, while it is still selected, right-click to view the context menu.

03:45
Now, click on Convert and select To 3D.

 03:48
The 2D rectangle is converted to a cuboid.

03:52
Let’s type "Rectangle" inside the rectangle shape.

03:55
However, we cannot type text inside 3D objects.

 04:00
To type text, we need to use the Text tool.

04:04
Click on the Text tool and draw a text-box inside the cuboid.

04:10
Type the text "Cuboid"' inside it.

04:14
The text-box and the cuboid are treated as two separate objects.  Therefore, let’s group them.

04:21
Similarly, we can colour and convert the square, circle and triangle into 3D objects.

04:30
We have used extrusion to create a chart of 2D and 3D figures.

04:36
Pause this tutorial and do this assignment.

04:40
Add a new page to your Draw file.

04:42
Draw a square and type the text "Square".

04:46
Convert the square with text to 3D.

04:49
Compare with the text from the 2D square text.

04:53
Hint: Use the 3D Settings toolbar to create 3D objects.

04:58
Draw also provides ready-made 3D shapes.

05:01
You can insert these shapes using the 3D Objects toolbar.

05:09
Let’s insert a new page in our Draw file.

05:13
Let’s select a shape from the 3D-Objects toolbar, say Shell.

05:18
Then draw it on the page.

 05:24
Draw also allows you to create 3D objects using body rotation on 2D objects.

05:33
Let’s draw a 2D shape, say a circle, on our Draw page.

05:39
Right-click for the context menu and select Convert. Then choose  To 3D Rotation Object.

 05:47
Observe what happens to the circle. It is now a 3D object.

 05:54
Click on the Fontwork Gallery icon on the Drawing toolbar at the bottom.

05:59
Let us select Favorite 16 and click on the OK button.

06:04
The text Fontwork is displayed on our Draw page.

06:09
We can re-size this text as required.

06:12
Now, we may want some other text in its place.  How do we do that?

06:17
Simply double-click inside the text "Fontwork".

 06:21
Now, you will be able to see the word Fontwork in black colour within the larger text.

06:26
Select this text and type "Spoken Tutorials".

06:30
Now, click anywhere on the Draw page.

06:33
The words "Spoken Tutorials" will now be displayed on the page.

06:36
Next, let us learn how to apply effects on 3D objects.

06:41
Let us apply effects to a spherical shape.

 06:44
So, let us select it and right-click for the context menu. Now select 3D Effects.

06:51
You can see various options here.

06:57
For demo purpose, let us change  Depth parameter to 3cm.

07:05
Under Segments, let us change Horizontal to 12.

07:10
Under Normal, let us select Flat option.

07:14
Observe the appearance of the object in its preview window.

07:19
Now, click on the Assign icon at the top right-hand corner of the dialog-box.

07:26
Next, click on the X mark at the top left-hand corner to exit the dialog-box.

 07:32
Observe our shape now.  The effects we selected have been applied to it.

07:38
Here is an assignment for you. Create a similar picture like the one shown on the slide.

07:45
Use the 3D Effects dialog-box to achieve this.

07:49
You can also create special effects using Duplication with 2D and 3D objects.

07:55
Let’s create a new page and draw a rectangle in it.

08:00
Let us create an effect using Duplication on the 2D rectangle.

08:04
From the Main menu, select Edit and click Duplicate.

08:09
The Duplicate dialog-box appears.

08:12
Let us enter the following values - Number of copies = 10

 08:18
Under Placement, X Axis = 10

08:26
Y Axis = 20

08:30
Angle = 0 degrees.

08:34
We will keep the Enlargement Width and Height as default.

08:44
We will change the Start color to Yellow, End color to Red.

08:57
Click OK.

08:58
Look at the great special effects that we have got!

09:04
You can get many more effects by changing the angles and the other values.

09:09
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
