Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on LibreOffice Draw - Basics of Layers and Password Encryption PDF.

00:09
In this tutorial, you will learn the basics of layers.

00:12
You will also learn how to protect a Draw file  using password encryption,

00:18
export it as PDF.

00:21
Here, we are using:  Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 as our operating system and
LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

00:30
Let us open the file 'Route Map'.

00:33
What are Layers?

 00:34
Layers are like transparent sheets, placed one on the top of another.

 00:42
There are three layers to every Draw file.

 00:44
The "Layout" layer is displayed by default

00:48
that is where we create most of our graphics.

 00:51
The "Controls" layer is used to store control elements such as buttons and forms.

00:57
The "Dimension" layer is used to depict dimension lines or measurement lines for complex drawings.

 01:06
For example, a drawing of a house must contain exact measurements of walls, positions of electrical wiring and so on.

 01:19
Let’s print three maps that show the route from the 'House' to the 'School'.

 01:26
Let’s call them Map 1, Map 2 and Map 3.

01:31
Map 1 shows all the landmarks in the area.

01:35
In Map 2, let’s show all the objects except the two 'Lakes', the 'Stadium' and the 'Commercial Complex'.

01:43
In Map 3, let’s show all the objects except the 'Park'.

 01:48
Do we need to create three separate maps to show these?

 01:51
No. The Draw provides a solution to this with the help of Layers.

01:58
This way, there can be only one map file with many layers of information.

02:03
We can print or view a combination of layers using one Draw page.

 02:10
Let us add some layers to the RouteMap.

02:13
Click on Layout layer.

02:15
Right-click and select Insert Layer.

02:18
The Insert layer dialog-box appears.

02:22
In the Name field, type: Layer four.

02:24
You can add any title and description that is relevant to your drawing.

02:30
Check the boxes “Visible” and “Printable”.

02:34
Click OK to exit the dialog-box.

02:37
Click on "Layout" layer once again.

02:40
On the Draw page, select the map and ungroup it.

02:44
Now, let us select the Lakes.

02:46
Press the Shift key and select the Stadium and the Commercial complex.

02:52
Next, right-click and select Cut.

02:55
Then click on “Layer four” layer and paste them.

02:59
They are pasted in the same positions as in the Layout layer.

03:04
Click Layer Four once again.

03:07
Right-click to view the context menu and select Modify Layer.

03:12
The Modify Layer dialog-box  appears.

03:15
Uncheck the box “Visible”. Click OK.

03:18
Objects in Layer Four are no longer visible.

03:21
The objects are present physically but are not visible.

03:26
Click Layout layer. If the tab is not seen then press the left-arrow button till the Layout layer is visible.

 03:35
We have our Map 2! In the same manner, we can create Map 3 also.

03:42
Pause this tutorial and do this assignment.

03:45
Create two routes from Home to the School Campus.

03:49
In the RouteMap drawing, create each route on a separate layer so that they can be printed as two different maps, each displaying only one route.

 04:01
Let us now learn how to export the file as a PDF and also password protect our Draw file.

04:10
First, let’s save the Draw file “RouteMap” as a 'PDF'.

04:14
From the main menu, select File and click “Export as PDF”.

04:19
The PDF dialog-box appears.

04:21
First, let us select the “General” options.

04:24
Click the “General” Tab.

04:26
Under Range, let us select All as we are converting all the pages in the Draw file to 'PDF'.

04:34
Under Images, we shall select “JPEG compression”.

04:38
This is the most common format that is used for compression.

04:42
Now, click on the Initial View tab.

04:45
We will keep the default values displayed in the dialog-box.

 04:49
Now, click on the Links tab.

 04:52
We may have inserted links in the Draw file.

04:55
Again, let’s keep the default values set for Links.

04:59
Now, let’s assign a password to protect the 'PDF' document.

05:03
To do so, click on the “Security” tab.

05:07
Click on the Set open password button.

05:10
The Set Open Password dialog-box appears.

 05:14
In the field “Password”,  type any password with which you want to protect your file.

05:20
I will set my password as “Protect101”.

05:24
In the field Confirm, I will re-type my password- “Protect101”. Click OK.

 05:31
Next, let’s set the permission password to print or modify the document.

05:37
Click on the Set permission password button.

05:41
In the field Password, type the password of your choice.  I will type ProtectAgain0.

05:49
In the field Confirm, I will retype the password ProtectAgain0  and click OK.

05:57
Notice that permissions for Printing and Changes are active now.

06:03
It is always a good practice to set passwords with a minimum of six characters, including numbers and special characters.

06:14
Under Printing, select the option Not Permitted.

 06:18
The 'PDF' can be printed only if the correct password is provided, else it cannot be printed.

06:25
Under Changes, select the option Not Permitted.

06:29
The Password can be edited only if the correct password is provided, else it cannot be modified.

06:36
Now, let us click the Export button at the bottom.

06:41
The Export dialog-box appears.

06:43
From the left panel, under Places, click on the location where you want to save your file. I will choose Desktop.

06:53
Under File type, click PDF - Portable Document Format.

06:57
And click on the Save button.

 07:01
The Draw file is converted to a PDF file and saved on the Desktop.

07:07
Let us switch to the Desktop now.

07:09
On the Desktop, double-click on the RouteMap PDF file.

 07:14
The Enter password dialog-box opens.

07:17
In the "Password" field, let's type the wrong password Protect111.

07:23
Click on the Unlock Document button.

 07:26
You will notice that the password' field is cleared and we are prompted to enter the password once again.

07:35
In the Password field, let’s type the correct password "Protect101".

07:40
Click on the Unlock Document button. The PDF file opens.

 07:46
We have converted our Draw file into PDF and successfully password-protected it!

07:53
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

07:57
