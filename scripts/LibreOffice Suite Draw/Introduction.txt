Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Introduction to LibreOffice Draw.

00:06
In this tutorial, we will learn about:
 LibreOffice Draw and the 
 LibreOffice Draw Workspace and


 00:13

 the context menu.  


00:15
We will also learn how to:
 Create, save, close and open a Draw file 
 Enable toolbars 
 Set up the Draw page and


00:25

 Insert basic shapes.


00:28
If you do not have LibreOffice Suite installed, Draw can be installed by using Synaptic Package Manager.

00:35
For more information on Synaptic Package Manager, please refer to the Ubuntu Linux Tutorials on this website

00:43
and download LibreOffice Suite by following the instructions on this website.

00:48
Detailed instructions are available in  the first tutorial of LibreOffice suit.

00:54
Remember, when installing, use the Complete option to install Draw.

00:59
LibreOffice Draw is a vector-based graphics software.

01:03
It allows you to create a wide range of vector graphics.

01:08
There are two major types of graphics – vector based graphics and bitmaps.

01:13
Vector graphics are created and edited using LibreOffice Draw.

01:18
The other is bitmap or the raster image.

01:21
Popular bitmap formats are 'BMP', 'JPG', 'JPEG' and 'PNG'.

01:30
Let us understand the difference between the two types by comparing the image formats.

01:35
The picture on the left is a vector graphic.

01:38
The one on the right is a bitmap.

01:41
Notice, what happens when the pictures are enlarged.

01:45
The vector graphic is clear; the bitmap image becomes blurred.

01:51
Vector-based graphics software stores images using lines and curves as mathematical formulae.

01:58
Therefore, when the images are resized, the picture quality is unaffected.

02:04
A bitmap uses pixels or a series of very small dots of colors in a grid or a square.

02:11
Can you see the small squares as we enlarge the picture?

02:15
These are the grids.

02:17
The small dots make up the color in each grid.

02:20
You may have noticed one other difference - bitmaps are rectangular in shape.

02:26
Vector graphics, however, can be in any shape.

02:30
Now that we know about vector graphics, let us learn how to create them using Draw.

02:36
Here, we are using:
 Ubuntu Linux' version 10.04 as our operating system and 
 LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.


02:46
To open a new Draw file, click on the Applications option at the top left corner of the screen.

02:54
And then click on Office and then on LibreOffice.

02:59
A dialog-box opens up with various LibreOffice components.

03:03
Click on Drawing.

03:05
This will open an empty Draw file.

03:09
Let’s  name our Draw file and save it.

03:12
Click on File in the Main menu and choose the “Save as” option.

03:18
The “Save as” dialog-box is displayed.

03:21
Let us type the name “WaterCycle” in the field File Name.

03:26
It's a good practice to assign a name that is relevant to the drawing.

03:31
The default file type for Draw files is the dot odg format ('.odg').

03:37
Using the Browse folders field, let us save this file on the Desktop.

03:42
Click on Save.

03:44
The file is saved as “WaterCycle”.

03:47
The Draw file with the file name and the extension is displayed in the Title bar.

03:53
We will learn how to create a picture of the water-cycle as shown in this slide.

03:59
We shall complete this picture in stages.

04:02
Each basic level tutorial will demonstrate how you can create different elements of this picture.

04:09
At the end of the basic level of Draw tutorials, you will also be able to create a similar diagram by yourself.

04:17
First, let us familiarize ourselves with the Draw workspace or the Draw window.

04:23
The Main menu lists all the options that we can use in Draw.

04:27
The Pages panel on the left, displays all the pages in the 'Draw' file.

04:32
The space where we create graphics is called a Page.

04:37
There are three layers in each page.

04:39
They are the Layout, Controls and Dimensions Lines.

04:44
The Layout layer is displayed, by default.

04:47
This is where we create most of our graphics.

04:51
We will work only with the Layout layer.

 04:54
Let us now explore the various toolbars available in LibreOffice Draw.

04:59
To view the toolbars available in Draw, go to the Main menu and click on View and then on Toolbars.

05:07
You will see a list of all the available  tools.

05:11
There is a check-mark to the left of certain toolbars.

05:15
This means the toolbar is enabled and is visible in the Draw window.

05:20
The option Standard has a check.

05:23
You can see the Standard toolbar on the window.

05:27
Let us now uncheck the Standard toolbar by clicking on it.

05:32
You see the Standard toolbar is no longer visible.

05:36
Let’s make it visible again.

05:39
Similarly, you can enable and disable the other toolbars too.

05:44
Before we draw the basic shapes for the water cycle diagram, let us set the page to Landscape view.

05:51
To do this, right-click on the page and choose the Page option.

05:56
Various sub-options are displayed.

05:59
Click Page Setup option.

06:02
The Page Setup dialog-box is displayed.

06:06
Under Page Format, we can see the Format field.

06:10
Here, we will choose A4 as this is the most common paper size used for printing.

06:17
When you select the format, the Width and Height fields are automatically filled with the default values.

06:25
Under the Orientation option, let us select Landscape.

06:29
To the right of the Paper format fields, you will see a tiny preview of the Draw page.

06:36
Click on OK.

06:38
Let us begin by drawing the sun.

06:41
On the Drawing toolbar, click on the small black triangle next to Basic Shapes.

06:47
Click on Circle.

06:49
Now, bring the cursor to the page >> hold the left mouse button and drag.

06:56
A circle is drawn on the page.

06:59
Now, let us draw a cloud next to the sun.

07:03
To do this, go to the drawing toolbar and select the “Symbol Shapes”.

07:08
Click on the small black triangle, next to Symbol Shapes and select the Cloud.

07:14
On the Draw page, place the cursor next to the sun.

07:18
Hold the left mouse button and drag.

07:21
You have drawn a cloud!

07:23
Next, let us draw a mountain.

07:25
We shall select Basic shapes again and click on Isosceles triangle.

07:30
We shall insert a triangle in the Draw page, as we did before.

07:35
Now, we have inserted three shapes.

 07:38
Remember to save your file every time you make a change.

07:42
Press the Ctrl+S keys together, to do this.

07:48
You can also set a time interval to save the changes automatically.

07:53
To do this: Go to the Main menu and select Tools.

07:57
Under Tools, click on Options.

08:00
The Options dialog-box appears.

08:03
Click on the plus sign next to Load/Save. Next, click on General. >> From the check-boxes on the right, >>

08:11
check the box Save AutoRrecovery information every and type “2”.

08:17
This means that the file will automatically be saved once every two minutes.

08:22
Click OK.

08:24
Let us now close this file by clicking on File and >> Close.

08:29
To open an existing Draw file- click on the File menu in the menu bar, at the top, and then click on the Open option.

08:38
A dialog-box appears on the screen.

08:41
Here, find the folder where you saved your document.

08:46
Select the file you want to open and click Open.

08:51
Here is an assignment for you.

08:53
Create a new Draw file and save it as MyWaterCycle.

08:57
Set the Page Orientation to Portrait.

09:00
Insert a cloud, a star and a circle.

09:04
Now, change the page Orientation to Landscape.

09:07
See how the placements of the figures change.

09:11
