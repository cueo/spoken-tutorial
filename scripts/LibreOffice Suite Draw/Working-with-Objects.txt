Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Working with Objects in LibreOffice Draw.

00:06
In this tutorial, we will learn how to:

00:08
* Position objects using Grids and Guide lines

00:12
* Use snap functions

00:14
* Customize lines and arrowheads.

00:18
You will also learn how to: * Duplicate objects

00:21
* Re-size objects exactly

00:24
* Distribute objects

00:25
* Combine, merge, subtract and intersect objects.

00:30
We are using:
 Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 as our operating system and 
 LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.


00:40
What are Grids?

00:42
Grids aid to position objects,

00:45
accurately on the Draw page.

00:48
Let us open the file RouteMap that was saved on the Desktop.

00:53
In the previous tutorials, we had briefly used grids.

00:57
Now, let us learn about grids in detail.

01:01
From the Main menu, select View and click on Grid.

01:05
Then click on Display Grid.

01:08
The Draw page is filled with a number of horizontal and vertical dotted lines. These form the grid.

01:17
These grids are for display purposes only. They will not be printed.

01:22
We can customize the size of the grids, that is, make them smaller or bigger as required.

01:30
From the Main menu, select Tools and click Options.

01:35
You will see the Options dialog-box.

01:38
Click LibreOffice Draw and select Grid.

01:42
Under Resolution, enter the following values:

01:46
 Horizontal – 7 cm

01:49
Vertical – 5 cm.

01:53
Subdivision decides the number of spaces in a grid.

01:57
Let us enter Subdivision values.

02:00
Horizontal – 3

02:02
Vertical – 4.

02:05
Let us leave the Synchronize axes option unchecked.

02:09
Click OK.

02:11
Look at the Draw page now. Look at the size of each box in the grid.

 02:17
Let us count the spaces that we set in the Subdivision.

02:22
Horizontally there are 1, 2, 3 spaces and vertically there are 1, 2, 3, 4 spaces.

 02:33
Let us learn about Guides.

02:36
What are Guides?

02:38
Guides are helper lines or extensions of the edges of the objects

02:43
that are displayed when it is moved.

 02:47
Let us enable the guidelines.

02:50
Go to the Main menu, select View and select the option Guides.

02:55
Now, click the option Display Guides.

02:59
From the Main menu, click Tools and Options.

03:03
The Options dialog-box appears.

03:06
From the left panel, click on the small black triangle next to LibreOffice Draw. Click View.

03:15
From the right panel, select Guides when moving. This way, you can see the guides when moving objects.

03:23
Click OK.

03:27
Now, let us move the park a little to the right.

03:29
When the park is moved, the extension lines of the edges of the object become visible. These are the Guidelines.

03:39
What are Snap Lines?

03:41
Snap Lines help us position two or more objects within an area that is defined.

03:48
Snap lines and Snap points are created by the user.

03:53
Snap lines run vertically and horizontally and appear as dashed lines.

 03:59
You must enable the Snap Lines option before you create snap lines.

04:05
Go to the Draw page. Right-click for the context menu and select Snap Lines.

04:12
Now, check all the three options:

04:16
Snap Lines Visible,

04:18
Snap to Snap Lines,

04:20
Snap Lines to Front.

 04:22
Snap lines that we create, will now be visible.

04:26
Let’s define an area, using Snap Lines, within which the objects in the map must fall (as shown in the slide).

04:34
Move the mouse cursor over the vertical ruler.

04:38
Press the left-mouse-button.

04:41
You will notice that the cursor is now shaped like a two-sided arrow.

04:46
Drag the mouse towards the Draw page.

04:50
You will see a dotted line.

04:53
Do not release the mouse-button.

04:55
Holding the left-mouse-button, drag the dotted line to the page.

05:01
Now, release the mouse-button.

 05:04
Can you see the line?

05:06
This is the Snap Line.

 05:07
To create the bottom most limit, simply drag the line to the bottom of the page.

05:13
Let’s create three more Snap Lines to define the area within which the map is enclosed.

 05:24
We have created horizontal and vertical Snap Lines.

05:29
Now you can position the objects along these Snap Lines.

05:34
 You can, of course, create as many Snap Lines as you want.

05:40
The horizontal and vertical Snap Lines function like the 'X' and 'Y' axes on a  graph.

05:48
Within these two axes, you can position objects exactly.

05:54
You can use the Snap function along with the grid lines to position objects accurately.

05:59
You can also: * Snap to Grid-  position an object exactly on grid points

06:06
* Snap to Snap lines - position an object exactly on a snap line

06:11
* Snap to Page margin - position an object exactly on the page margin.

06:18
Pause this tutorial and do this assignment.

06:21
Explore all the Grid options.

06:24
Check what happens to objects when you snap to Grid, snap lines and page margins.

06:31
Now let’s add one more lake, in the exact shape of this lake, next to the School Campus.

 06:38
To do this, let’s use the Duplicate option.

06:43
Let’s select the Lake.

06:45
Go to the Main menu', select Edit and click on Duplicate.

06:51
The Duplicate dialog-box appears.

06:54
In Number of copies, enter the value 1 and click OK.

 06:59
The Lake is duplicated.

07:03
Let’s drag the lake and place it near the school.

 07:06
Objects can also be re-sized exactly to any measurement that is required.

07:11
Let’s use the exact measurements and change the shape of the House as shown in this slide.

 07:18
Let’s give it the same height and width and slant its corners and rotate it.

07:24
First, select Home, right-click for the context menu and select Position and Size.

07:31
The Position and Size  dialog-box appears.

07:35
Click the Position and Size tab.

07:38
Under Size, enter the value 3 in both the Width and Height fields.

07:43
Then click the Rotation tab.

07:46
In the Angle field, enter the value 10.

07:50
Finally, select the Slant and Corner Radius tab.

07:55
In the Slant Angle field, enter 5 degrees.

07:59
Click OK.

 08:01
We have re-designed the house!

08:05
Pause this tutorial and do this assignment.

08:08
# Draw various shapes using the Drawing tool bar.

08:11
# Check if you can apply Corner radius to all shapes.

08:16
Now, let’s space the right edges of some objects evenly.

 08:21
We will use the Distribution option to achieve this.

08:26
 We must select at least three objects  to use the Distribution option.

08:32
First, select the Residential Complex, the Parking Lot and the Commercial Complex.

08:39
Let’s group them by dragging the Select arrow to cover all the objects.

08:45
Now, right-click and select Distribution.

08:50
Under Horizontal, select Right.  Click OK.

08:56
The right edges of the objects will be distributed evenly.

09:01
The Distribution option does not distribute the objects horizontally or vertically.

09:07
The Horizontal Distribution option distributes-

09:10
* The right and left edges

09:12
* The horizontal centers and

09:14
* The spacing of the objects.

09:17
The Vertical option distributes-

09:21
* The top and bottom edges
 The vertical centers and 
 The spacing of the objects.


 09:26
Now, let’s create our own line style for this map.

09:32
From the Main menu, select Format and click Line.

09:35
The Line dialog-box appears.

09:38
Click on the Line Styles tab.

09:41
In Line Styles, select the option Three dashes and three dots.

09:47
Leave the Type field as it is.

09:50
In Number, let’s enter 10 and 5; Length as  8%.

09:57
Click Add. Enter the name "My Line Style". Click OK.

10:06
Again click OK.

10:08
Let’s select this arrow. Right-click and select Line. The Line dialog-box appears.

10:13
Click the Line tab.

10:16
Click on the Style drop-down box.

10:19
It now displays the new style that was created.

10:22
Select it and click OK.

10:26
We have created a new line style!

 10:29
Let’s draw a small stadium to the left of the School Campus.

10:34
From the Drawing toolbar, click Basic Shapes and select a Circle.

10:40
Let’s enter it in the Draw page.

10:44
The outline of the circle is of the style My Line Style.

10:49
Let’s type “Stadium” inside it.

 10:53
Now, let’s learn to combine, merge, subtract and intersect objects.

10:59
What is the difference between Grouping and combining objects?

11:03
When objects are grouped, a number of objects are just put together.

11:09
When objects are combined, new object is created.

 11:13
We will use three objects to demonstrate these options.

11:18
First, let us add a new page to the Draw file.

11:23
Let’s draw a circle from the Drawing toolbar- click Basic Shapes and select Circle.

11:32
Move the mouse in the Draw page and drag it down.

11:35
Let’s  draw a second object  Diamond.

11:38
From the Drawing toolbar, click Basic Shapes and select  Diamond.

11:43
Move  the cursor  to  the Draw page, drag it  down. And from the menu bar, select Area Style / Filling drop down button and select color Red 3.

11:55
Draw a  third object, a Rectangle, and color the object as Green 6.

12:02
Select the three objects by holding down the Shift key and clicking on each object.

12:11
Right-click for the Context menu and click Combine.

12:14
A new object is created!

 12:18
Notice that the new object takes the color of the object that is last and at the back.

12:24
Let us undo this action by pressing the CTRL+Z keys together.

12:29
Select the figures again and right-click for the context menu.

12:35
Select Shapes and click Merge.

12:38
Another new shape is created!

 12:41
Remember the more you experiment with these functions, the more you will learn.

12:48
This brings us to the end of the tutorial.

12:51
In this tutorial, you have learnt how to use Grids, Guides and snap lines to align objects accurately.

12:59
You have also learnt to Duplicate, Resize objects and distribute objects.

13:06
