Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Flowcharts, Glue Points and Beizer curvesin LibreOffice Draw.

00:08
In this tutorial, you will learn to draw Beizer curvesand Flowcharts.

00:14
 You will also learn how to connect Flowcharts using Connectors and Glue points.

00:20
 Here, we are using:
 Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 and  
 LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.


 00:29
Let’s learn about Bezier Curves.

00:33
Bezier Curves are used mainly in computer graphics to make curves smoother.

00:40
You can use these curves to experiment with the shape and size of curves.

00:45
All curves have a start point and an end point.

00:50
The points on the curve are referred to as Nodes.

00:54
Let us go to our 'Routemap' file.

00:58
Let’s go to the Commercial Complex from Home.

01:03
To do so, we have to go right from the Parking Lot.

01:08
Remember, previously we had grouped the drawing. So, let’s ungroup it.

01:14
Now, from the Drawing toolbar, click Curve and select Curve.

01:20
On the Draw page, click on the start point of the route - this is Home.

01:27
Keep the left-mouse-button pressed and drag till the Play Ground. 

01:32
You will see a straight line.

01:36
Release the mouse button.

01:39
Now, move the pointer to the Commercial Complex.

01:43
The line will curve as the mouse moves.

01:47
Double-click at the end point, that is, the Commercial Complex.

01:52
We have drawn a curve!

01:55
Notice that the curve transition is smooth.

 01:59
Now, let us edit the points on this curve using the Edit Points toolbar.

02:05
Click on the curve.

02:07
To enable the Edit Points toolbar, right-click on the curve and choose Edit Points.

02:14
When the blue boxes appear at the end-points of the curve, we can edit the curve.

02:21
Click on the start point of the curve.

02:24
You will see a dotted line with a control point.

02:29
You can now drag the dotted line to reduce or expand the curve, as required.

02:35
Double-click anywhere on the Draw page, once you have made a change.

 02:41
You can use the Edit Points toolbar to insert, move or delete points on the curve to create a smoother curve.

02:50
Here is a small assignment for you.

02:54
Draw a Bezier curve and work with all the options

02:59
 using the Edit Points toolbar.

 03:02
Now, let us learn to create Flowcharts.

03:05
Let’s add 2 new pages to the file RouteMap.

03:10
Draw provides a separate option in the Drawing toolbar for Flowcharts.

03:17
This flowchart shows all the stages in the Spoken Tutorial process.

 03:22
Let’s create this flowchart.

03:26
From the Drawing toolbar, click on Flowcharts.

03:30
Click on the small black triangle and select Flowchart: Process.

03:37
Place the cursor on the Draw page, hold the left-mouse-button and drag it down.

 03:44
You have drawn a Process box.

 03:47
A Process box represents a step or an event in the entire process.

 03:54
We can insert text in flowchart objects too.

03:59
Let’s double-click on the Process box and type the text "Create the Tutorial Outline to chunk content into 10-minute scripts" inside it.

 04:13
Formatting options for Flowcharts are also similar to that of other objects.

 04:20
Now, let’s align the text inside the Process box.

04:24
Let us select the text.

04:27
Right-click to view the Context menu and click Text.

 04:32
The Text dialog-box appears.

04:35
In the Text dialog-box, check the box "Resize shape to fit text width". Click OK.

 04:43
You will see that the Process box has changed its shape to fit the text!

04:49
Now, let us undo this action by pressing the Ctrl+Z keys together.

04:55
Again, let’s select the text.

04:59
Go to the Main menu and select Format and click Text.

05:05
The  Text dialog-box appears.

05:08
Let us check the option "Word wrap text in shape". Click OK.

 05:15
The text has adjusted itself to fit the shape of the Process box.

05:21
In the same manner, let us now draw another Process box beneath the first one.

05:28
Let us insert the text "Create Scripts" inside it.

05:33
Now, let's draw a Decision box and insert the text "Review Okay?" inside it.

 05:42
A Decision box represents a decision that has to be made.

05:46
It directs us to the next process based on the outcome of the decision.

05:52
Let us now draw another Process box beneath the Decision box.

05:58
Let us insert the text "Record Video" inside it.

06:04
Next, we need another Decision box here with the text "Review Okay?".

06:12
Let’s copy the Decision box, we created before, and place it here.

06:18
So, select the Decision box and press the Ctrl+C keys together.

06:25
Now, press the Ctrl+V keys together.

06:29
Let’s move this box beneath the previous Process box.

06:35
Now, enter the text  "Review Okay" inside it.

06:40
Finally, let’s draw a flowchart-connector and type 'A' inside it.

 06:48
A flowchart-connector connects two parts of a flowchart.

06:53
Let’s say that the first part of the flowchart is on one page

06:58
and the second part on another page.

07:02
We draw a flowchart-connector at the end of the flowchart on the first page.

07:08
Then we draw the same connector at the beginning of the second page.

 07:13
Before we connect the objects, let us learn about Connector Lines and Glue Points in Draw.

07:21
Connectors are lines or arrows whose ends are attached or docked to an object.

07:28
Glue points- as the name indicates are the points that glue the connectors to the objects.

07:35
All the objects have glue points.

07:39
These are invisible;

07:41
they become visible when a connector is selected from the Drawing toolbar or when the mouse pointer is moved over an object.

07:51
Glue points are not the same as handles.

07:54
We use handles to re-size the object.

07:58
Glue points are used to glue the connector to an object.

08:02
Now, let us connect the objects in the flowchart using connectors.

08:07
Go to the Drawing toolbar and select Connector.

08:12
Click on the small black triangle to see the different types of Connectors.

08:18
Let us select the option Straight Connector ends with Arrow.

08:23
When you select the Connector, you will see cross marks on all the objects in the Draw page.

08:31
These are the glue points.

 08:34
Now, let’s draw a line from the glue point of the first process box to glue point of the next process box.

08:44
We will connect all the flowchart objects, in a top-to-down manner, using connectors.

08:52
You will notice that every line automatically docks itself to the nearest glue point, wherever you place the cursor.

 09:03
Now, let’s connect the Process and Decision boxes.

09:08
From the Drawing toolbar, select the option Connector Ends with Arrow.

09:14
From the Process box, let’s connect to the Decision box.

09:19
Similarly, let’s connect the Decision box with the next Process box.

 09:25
You can also add text to a connector.

 09:29
On the connector from the Decision box to the Process box, let us type: "No".

09:35
To select the connector, just double-click on it.

 09:39
The end control-points become active

09:43
and the text cursor appears.

09:46
Let us type the text "No".

09:49
Let us do this once more for the other connector.

09:54
We have created a simple flowchart!

09:57
Let’s save our flowchart by pressing Ctrl+S keys.

 10:03
You can also connect the objects using lines and arrows too.

10:08
But in that case, you should group the objects.

10:11
This is because arrows do not stay docked to objects.

10:16
How are connectors different from Lines and Arrows?

10:21
Connectors are lines or arrows

10:24
whose end-points are automatically docked

10:28
to the glue points of an object.

10:31
Lines and Arrows, on the other hand, do not dock automatically.

10:36
Pause this tutorial and do this assignment.

10:40
Create the second part of the Spoken Tutorial flowchart.

10:45
Color the process boxes.

10:48
Draw a connector with the letter 'A'.

10:51
It should be the first object in this flowchart.

10:55
It should look like this.

  10:59
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

11:02
