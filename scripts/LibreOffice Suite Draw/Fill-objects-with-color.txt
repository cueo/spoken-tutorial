 Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Fill Objects with Color in LibreOffice Draw.

00:06
 In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

00:09

 Fill objects with color, gradients, hatching and bitmaps


00:15

 Set page backgrounds


00:17

 Create new colors. 


00:20
 Let us begin by opening the file WaterCycle.

00:24
 You can fill objects with:* Colors* Gradients

 00:29

 Line patterns or hatching and * Pictures.


 00:33
 Here, we are using:
 Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 and 
 LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.


00:42
 Let us color the WaterCycle diagram.

 00:46
 Let’s begin by coloring the two clouds next to the sun. We shall fill them with white.

 00:54
 Select the cloud next to the sun.

 00:56
Right-click to view the context menu and click Area.

 01:01
 The Area dialog-box is displayed.

01:05
Click the Area tab and under the Fill option, select Color.

01:13
Scroll down and click on White.

01:16
Click OK.

01:19
 In the same way, we will colour the other cloud too.

01:24
Right-click under Area, Color and White.

01:30
 Coloring each cloud will take a long time.

01:33
An easier way to do this is to group them.

01:38
 Let’s color the other two clouds  in gray as they are rain-bearing clouds.

01:46
 First let’s group them.

01:48
Press the Shift key and click the first cloud and then click on the second.

01:54
 Right-click for the context menu and click Group.

01:58
The clouds are now grouped.

02:00
 Again, right-click for the context menu and click Area.

02:07
 In the Area dialog-box, click the Area tab. Under the Fill option, select Color and scroll down and click on the colour Gray 70%.

02:23
Click OK.

 02:25
 Let’s color the triangle brown 3 in the same way.

02:37
Now, let’s color the rectangle in brown 4 in the same way, again.

02:48
 Similarly, let's colour the sun yellow.

 02:58
 Next, let’s color the other triangle and curve that represents water with the colour turquoise 1.

03:05
As they require the same formatting, let’s group them if they are not already grouped.

03:12
 To color them, let’s follow the same steps as in the previous ones - right-click, Area -> Area tab -> Fill -> color -> turquoise 1.

 03:27
 Observe that in the object water, the outlines of the triangle and the curve are  displayed.

03:35
Let’s make these outlines invisible so that the picture looks better.

03:41
 Select the object, right-click to view the context menu and click Line.

 03:48
  The Line dialog-box is displayed.

 03:52
Click the Line tab .

03:55
 In Line properties, click on the Style drop-down box and select Invisible.

04:03
Click OK.

04:05
The outline of water object becomes invisible.

 04:09
 Now, let us color the trees.

04:14
 Let us select the left-most tree.

04:16
Right-click to view the context-menu and click on Enter Group.

04:23
Now, let’s edit the tree.

04:26
 Select the leaves on the right.

04:30
Right-click for the context menu and click Area.

04:36
In the  Area dialog-box,

04:38
click the Area tab.

 04:40
Under Fill, select Color.

04:44
Scroll down and click on Green 5.

 04:47
Click OK.

 04:49
Let us do the same for the leaves on the left.

04:57
 Let’s color the trunk of the tree next.

05:05
 Select the Y-shaped arrow, right-click for the context menu and click Area.

05:08
Notice that all the previous selections are retained in the Area dialog-box.

05:15
So, let's  select Color.

05:18
Scroll down and click on Brown 1.

05:21
Click OK.

05:23
We have colored the tree!

05:26
 To exit the group, right-click and select Exit Group.

05:31
 We can color the other trees in the same way.

05:36
 We can also delete the other trees, copy-paste the colored tree and move it to the desired location.

05:44
It is much easier this way, isn’t it?

05:49
Now, let us add a shadow to the cloud next  to the Sun.

 05:55
 Let’s click Select from the Drawing toolbar to select and then group them.

06:03
 Select the white cloud group and right-click for the context menu and click Area.

06:10
 In the Area dialog-box, click the Shadow tab.

06:15
In Properties, check the Use Shadow box.

06:20
The other fields now become active.

06:24
 In Position, click the bottom-right corner option.

06:29
“Position” defines where the shadow will appear.

06:33
 In the Color field, select Gray.

06;36
Click OK.

06:39
 A shadow is displayed behind each white cloud.

 06:44
 Now, let’s make the clouds look more realistic.

06:48
 Select the gray cloud group and right-click to view the context menu and select Area.

 06:55
 In the “Area” dialog-box, select Area tab. Under Fill, click Gradient.

07:02
Now select Gradient1.

07:04
Click OK.

07:06
The cloud now has a more realistic shade of gray!

07:11
 Select a shape - say a cloud group.  Right-click for the context menu and click Area.

07:19
The Area tab options are visible.

07:23
Under Fill, you will see the 4 options -

07:27
Color, Gradient, Hatching and Bitmap.

07:32
 Notice that there is a corresponding tab in the dialog-box for each of these options.

 07:39
 These tabs allow us to create and save new styles.

07:43
 Let’s click on the Colors tab.

 07:46
 Under Properties, let’s select Red 3 from the Color drop-down.

 07:53
 Then, select RGB and enter the values for 'R', 'G' and 'B' as shown.

 08:01
R, G and B stand for the proportion of Red, Green and Blue in any color.

08:08
 We will enter 200 for R, 100 for G and 50 for B.

08:16
 Here we are changing the proportion of red, green and blue to change the color.

08:22
 Look at the preview box, above the RGB field.

08:28
 The first preview box displays the original color.

 08:31
 The second preview box, next to the Color field, shows the changes that we made.

08:37
 Let’s type a name for this, in the Name field.

08:41
Let’s enter the name New red.

08:44
Click on the Add button.

08:46
The new color is added to the list.

08:49
 Click OK.

08:51
We have created a new color!

08:54
 Let’s undo this action by pressing Ctrl and Z.

08:59
The colour of the cloud reverts to white, again.

09:03
 You can create your own gradients and hatching too, using the tabs in the Area dialog-box.

09:10
 Gradients are shades that blend from one color to the other.

09:14
 For example, the color shade moves from blue to green.

09:18
 Hatching is a shading or texture in drawing that is created using fine parallel lines.

 09:24
 Now, let’s learn how to import a bitmap into Draw.

09:28
 From the Main menu, select Format and click Area.

 09:33
 As seen earlier, the Area dialog-box opens. Click on the Bitmaps tab.

09:39
 Now, click on the Import button.

09:42
 The Import dialog-box appears.

09:45
 Browse and select a bitmap.

09:48
 Click on the  Open button.

09:50
 Draw prompts you to enter a name for the Bitmap.

 09:55
 Let’s enter the name NewBitmap.

09:58
 Click OK.

10:00
 The Bitmap now appears in the drop-down list.

10:04
 Click OK to exit.

10:07
 Observe the clouds now.

10:10
 Let’s undo this by pressing Ctrl and Z keys.

10:14
 Let us use bitmaps to fill the object “water”.

 10:19
 Now, let us make the water look more realistic.

10:22
 To do this, select the grouped triangle and curve.

 10:26
 Right-click for the context menu and select Area.

10:31
 In the Area dialog-box, click the Bitmaps tab.

 10:36
 Scroll down the list of bitmaps and select Water.

10:41
 Click OK.

10:43
 The water looks more realistic now!

10:46
 Pause this tutorial and do this assignment.

 10:50
 Draw objects and fill them with color, gradients, hatching and bitmaps.

10:57
 Use the Transparency tab and see its effects on the objects.

 11:02
 Let’s color the sky now. This is simple!

11:06
 We just apply a background to the whole page.

11:10
 Click the cursor on the page to ensure no objects are selected.

11:15
 Right-click for the context menu.

11:21
 Click Page and select Page setup. The Page setup  dialog-box is displayed.

11:25
 Click the Background tab and under Fill,  select Color.

11:30
 Let’s scroll down  and select the color Blue 8.

11:34
 Click OK.

11:36
 Draw asks you if this background setting should be for all pages.

11:41
 Click NO.

11:44
 Now only the selected page has a background color.

11:48
 You can also choose not to fill the object with any color.

11:52
 Let us select the mountain.

11:55
 Right-click for the context menu and select Area.

11:59
 In the Area dialog-box, select the Area tab.

12:04
 Under Fill, select None.

12:06
 Click OK.

 12:08
 The object is not filled with any color and only the outline is seen against the background.

12:15
 To undo the action, press Ctrl+Z keys.

12:20
 You can also access all these options from the Format menu.

12:25
 Remember to save your file by pressing Ctrl+S keys together, every time you make a change.

 12:34
 Alternately, set the Automatic Save option so that the changes are saved automatically.

12:41
 Here is another assignment for you.
