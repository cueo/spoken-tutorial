00.15
Here, we are using:

Background refers to all the colors and effects applied to the slide which are present behind the content.

00.38
You can even create your own custom backgrounds.

00.42
 Let’s open the presentation "Sample-Impress.odp".

00.48
Let’s create a custom background for our presentation.

00.52
We shall also apply this background to all the slides in the presentation.

 Let’s now learn how to add other design elements to this presentation.

03.57
For example, you can add a logo to your presentation.

04.01
 Look at the Basic Shapes toolbar in the bottom of your screen.

04.06
 You can use it to draw a variety of basic shapes such as circles, squares, rectangles, triangles and ovals.

04.16
 Let’s draw a rectangle in the Title area of the slide.

 From the Basic Shapes toolbar, click on Rectangle.

04.25
 Now, move the cursor to the top left corner of the slide, in the Title area.

04.36
 Hold the left mouse button and drag to draw a small rectangle.

04.41
Now, release the mouse-button.

04.44
 You have drawn a rectangle!

04.47
 Notice the eight handles on the rectangle.

04.50
 Handles or control points are the small blue squares that appear on the sides of the selected object.

04.58
 We can use these control points to adjust the size of the rectangle.

05.03
 As you hover your cursor over the control point, the cursor changes to a double-sided arrow.

05.10
This indicates the directions in which the control point can be moved to manipulate the basic shapes.

05.17
 Let’s enlarge this rectangle so that it covers the title area completely. <Pause>

05.25
 We can format these shapes too!

05.28
 Right-click on the rectangle to view the context menu.

05.32
 Here, you can choose various options to modify the rectangle.

05.48
 Choose Magenta 4 and click OK.

05.52
 The color of the rectangle has changed.

05.56
 The rectangle has now covered the text.

05.59

06.03
 Now, right-click to open the context menu.

06.07
 Click on Arrange and then Send to back.

06.39
 Notice that the rectangle is also displayed in all the pages.

06.45
 Let us learn to change the layout of the slide.

06.49
 What are Layouts? Layouts are slide templates that are pre-formatted for position of content with place holders.

06.58
 To view the slide layouts, from the right panel, click Layouts.

07.04
 The layouts available in Impress are displayed.

07.07
 Look at the layout thumbnails. It gives you an idea of how the slide will appear after the layout has been applied.

7.16
 There are layouts with the titles and two-columnar formats, layouts where you can position text in three columns and so on.

7.24
 There are also blank layouts.  You can apply a blank layout to your slide and then create your own layouts.

07.32
 Let’s apply a layout to a slide.

07.35
 Select the slide "Potential Alternatives" and delete all text.

07.43
 Now, from the Layouts pane on the right hand side, select Title, 2 Content over Content.

07.51
 The slide now has three text-boxes and a title area.

07.56
 Notice that the rectangle we inserted using the Master page, is still visible.

08.02
This rectangle can only be edited using the Master slide.

08.07
The settings in the Master slide override any formatting changes or layouts applied to slides.

08.15
 Let’s enter content in these boxes now.

08.19
 In the first text box, type: "Strategy 1 PRO: Low cost CON: slow action".

08.28
 In the second text-box, type: "Strategy 2 CON: High cost PRO: Fast Action".

08.40
 In the third text-box, type: "Due to lack of funds, Strategy 1 is better".

08.48
 You can similarly choose the layout type that is most suited to your presentation.
