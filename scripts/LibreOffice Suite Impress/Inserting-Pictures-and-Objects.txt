Insert a new slide after the slide titled ‘Overview’ by clicking on Insert and Slide.

01:50
Click on the Title text-box and change the title to ‘OpenSource Funny’.

In a similar manner we can also insert other objects like charts and movie-clips into our presentation.

02:35
Explore all these possibilities.

02:38
Now let's learn how to hyperlink.

02:41
Hyperlinking allows you to easily move from slide to slide or open a web-page or a document from the presentation.

02:49
First, we will look at how to hyperlink within a presentation.

02:54
Insert a new slide after the slide titled "Overview".

03:02
Click on the title and type: "Table of Contents".

03:07
Click on the Body text-box and type the titles of the succeeding slides as follows:

03:13
"Open Source Funny"
"The Present Situation"
"Development up to present" 
"Potential Alternatives"  
"Recommendation".

03:24
Select the line of text "Development up to present".

03:28
Click on Insert and Hyperlink.

03:31
This will open the hyperlink dialog-box.

03:34
On the left pane, select Document. Then click on the button to the right of the field ‘Target in document’.

03:48
The list of slides present in this presentation opens up.

03:53
Select the slide titled "Development up to present" from the list.

03:58
Click on the Apply button and then click on the Close button in this list.

04:04
Again, click on the Apply button and then click on the Close button in the Hyperlink dialog-box.

04:12
Click anywhere in the slide.

04:14
Now, when you hover your cursor over the text, the cursor turns into a pointing finger.

04:20
This means that the hyperlinking was successful!

04:24
Clicking on the hyperlinked text takes you to the relevant slide.

04:29
To hyperlink to another document, let's go back to the "Table of Contents" slide.

04:35
Now, add another line item: "External Document".

04:40
Select the line of text and click on Insert and then on Hyperlink.

04:45
In the left pane, select Document.

04:48
Click on the folder icon to the right of the 'Document Path' field.

04:55

04:58
We will choose 'resume.odt' which we created in the Writer series and click on the Open button.

05:07
Click on the Apply button and then click on the Close button in the Hyperlink dialog-box.

05:14
Click anywhere on the slide.

05:17
Now, when you hover your cursor over the text, the cursor turns into a pointing finger.

05:22
This means that the hyperlinking was successful!

05:26
Now, clicking on the hyperlinked text takes you to the relevant document.

05:31
In our case, it takes us to "resume.odt". <PAUSE>

05:36
Hyperlinking to a web-page is similar.

05:40
Insert a new slide at the end of the presentation.

05:43
Change the title to "Essential Open Source Software".

05:48
In the Body text-box, type: "Ubuntu Libre Office".

05:53
Select the second line of text and click on Insert and then on Hyperlink.

06:00
On the left pane, select Internet.

06:03
In the Hyperlink type, select Web.

06:07
In the Target field, type: ‘www.libreoffice.org’.

06:16
Click on the Apply button and then click on the Close button in the Hyperlink dialog-box.

06:23
Click anywhere on the slide.

06:26
Now, when you hover your cursor over the text, the cursor turns into a pointing finger.

06:32
This means that the hyperlinking was successful!

06:37
Now, clicking on the hyperlinked text takes you to the relevant web page.

06:44
Lastly, tables are used to organize data into columns and rows.

06:49
Let’s now learn how to add a table in LibreOffice Impress.

06:54

07:00
From the Layout section on the Tasks pane, select Title and 2 Content icon.

07:07
Select the text in the left side text-box

07:14
and reduce the font size to 26.

07:17
In the right side text-box, click on the icon Insert Table from the Insert toolbar in the centre.

07:25
By default, Number of columns is displayed as 5 and Number of rows is displayed as 2.

07:33
We will change the Number of columns to 2 and the Number of rows to 5.

07:41
Click on the OK button.

07:44
Let's elongate the table so that the text is readable.

07:49
Enter data into the table as shown-

07:51
"Implementation Year and % "

07:56
"2006"  "10%"

07:59
"2007"  "20%"

08:02
"2008"  "30%"

08:05
"2009	  "40%"

08:08
Now, let's change the font of the header row to bold and center the text.

08:17
To change the color of the table, first select all the text.

08:22
Then from the Table Design section, on the Tasks pane, select a Table Style.  I will select this one.

08:30
