Welcome to this spoken tutorial of LibreOffice Impress - Printing a Presentation.

00.06
In this tutorial, we will learn about the various options for printing -

00.11
Slides, Handouts, Notes and Outline.

00.16
Here, we are using:
Ubuntu Linux 10.04 and LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

00.25
There are times when you would need to print hard-copies of your presentation.

00:29
For example, you may want to give copies of your presentation to your audience for later reference.

00.35
So first, let us open our presentation "Sample Impress" by double-clicking on it.

00.41
To take prints of your slides, click on File and Print. Alternately, we can press Ctrl and P keys together.

00.50
To know about the settings under General and Options tabs, <PAUSE>

00.55
please see the tutorial on Viewing and printing Documents in the LibreOffice Writer series.

 01:02
In the General tab, under Print, in the Document field, we see various options which are unique to Impress.

01:09
These options allow us to take prints of our slides in the desired format -

01:15
Slides, Handouts, Notes and Outline. We will choose the Slides option.

01:22
Now, let's click on the LibreOffice Impress tab.

01:26
Here, you can choose the parts of the slide that you want to print, the print colours and the size.

01:34
Under Contents, let’s select Slide name, Date and time and Hidden pages.

01:41
As the text describes, these will print the name of the slide, the date and time and hidden pages, if any.

01:49
Then, under Color, let’s select Grayscale.

01:53
As the text describes, the other options will print the slide in its original colour or in black-and-white.

02:00
And, under Size, let’s select Fit to printable page. You can explore the other Size options in the LibreOffice Impress tab on your own.

02:10
Depending on the purpose for which you are taking the prints, various options are available in the Page Layout tab.

02:18
Let’s say- you want to have a number of slides in the same page of the printout.

02:23
So, select Pages per sheet.  By default, it prints 1 slide per page.

02:29
Here is a small preview of the page.

02:33
Click on the drop-down arrow and choose the number of pages that you want to print per page.

02:39
If we choose 2 then in the preview, we can see 2 pages. If we choose 6 then in the preview, we can see 6 pages.

02:48
Checking 'Draw a border around each page' option, creates a black border around each page while printing.

02:56
This makes the page look more attractive.

02:59
The next option, Brochure, allows us to print the slides as brochures, for easy binding.

03:06
However, in this case, we will not choose this option. You can explore this option on your own, later.

03:14
Ensure that all the check-boxes in the Options tab are unchecked.

03:19
These check-boxes are for special purposes which we will not discuss in this tutorial.

03:25
Now, click on the Print button.

03:28
If the printer is configured correctly, the printer should start printing now. <PAUSE>

03:36
Next, let's learn about the Handouts option. Click on File and Print.

03:41
And in the General tab, under Print, in the Document field, choose Handout.

03:47
By default, there are 4 slides per page and the default order is left to right, then down. Leave these unchanged for this presentation.

03:58
In the LibreOffice Impress tab, you will find that the Size options are disabled.

04:05
This is because, the size of the print is determined by the number of slides in the sheet and size of the sheet.

04:12
Now, click on the Print button.

04:15
If the printer is configured correctly, the printer should start printing now.

04:20
Let's go to the first slide and click on the Notes tab.

04:25
Here, we will type in a note: “This is a sample note”.

04:30
To print your notes which you typed for your slides, click on File and Print.

04:35
In the General tab, under Print, in the Document field, choose the Notes option.

04:42
Look at the preview page on the left. It shows the note you typed, at the bottom of the slide.

04:48
Now, click on the LibreOffice Impress tab.

04:52
Notice that the Size options are not available when we print Notes.

04:57
Now, click on the Print button. If the printer is configured correctly, the printer should start printing now.

05:05
Lastly, to print the outline of the slides for quick reference during a presentation, click on File and Print.

05:13
In the General tab, under Print, in the Document field, choose the Outline option.

05:19
Look at the preview page on the left. It shows the outline or the sequence of your slides with the slide headings and sub-points.

05:28
Now, click on the LibreOffice Impress tab.

05:32
Notice once again that Size options are not available when we print Outline.

05:38
Now click on  the Print button. If the printer is configured correctly, the printer should start printing now.

05:47
