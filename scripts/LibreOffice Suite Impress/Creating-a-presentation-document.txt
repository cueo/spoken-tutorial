Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on LibreOffice Impress - Creating a presentation document and basic formatting.

00:08
In this tutorial, we will learn about: The parts of the Impress window and
How to- insert slides, copy slides, about Fonts and formatting of fonts.

00:21
Here, we are using:
Ubuntu Linux 10.04 and 
LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

00:29
Let's open our presentation “Sample Impress” that we created in the previous tutorial.

00:35
Let's take a tour of what is on the screen.

00:39
In the centre, we see the Workspace which is our working area.

00:44
As you can see, the “Workspace” has 5 tabs called the “View buttons”.

00:49
Currently the Normal tab is selected.

00:52
This is the main view for creating individual slides.

00:55
The Outline view shows topic titles, bulleted and numbered lists for each slide in outline format.

01:03
The Notes view lets you add notes to each slide that are not seen when the presentation is shown.

01:10
The Handout view allows to print the slides for a handout.

01:14
Here, we can choose the number of slides that we want to print per page.

01:19
The Slide Sorter view shows thumbnails of the slides.

01:23
Let's click on the “Normal” view button again.

01:26
On the left hand side of the screen, you see the Slides pane. It contains thumbnails of the slides in the presentation.

01:34
On the right hand side, you see the Tasks pane which has 5 sections.

01:40
The Layouts section has pre-packaged layouts.

01:43
We can use these directly or modify them as per our requirements.

01:48
We should see each of these sections in detail as we progress through the tutorial series.

 01:53
Now, let's learn how to insert a slide. Select the second slide, in the “Slides” pane, by clicking on it.

02:02
Now, we click on Insert and Slide.

02:05
We see that a new blank slide has been inserted after the second slide.

02:10
To add a title to the slide, click on the text bar that says ‘Click to add Title’.

02:17
Now, type: "Short Term Strategy" and click outside the text-box.

02:23
So, a title can be added in this way.

02:26
There are two ways in which we can make a copy of a slide.

02:30
Let’s look at the first way; click on Insert and Duplicate Slide.

02:35
We can see that a new duplicate slide has been inserted after the one we created in the previous step.

02:42
Alternately, go to the slide sorter view by clicking on the Slide Sorter tab in the Workspace pane.

02:50
Now, copy the 7th slide by right-clicking on it and selecting Copy from the context menu.

02:58
Right-click on the last slide and select Paste.

03:01
Select After and click OK.

03:04
You have now created a copy of the slide at the end of the presentation!

03:10
Now, let’s look at fonts and some of the ways that you can format fonts.

03:15
Select the slide titled "Long term goal" by double-clicking on it.

03:20
Click on the Body text box and select all the text.  Now delete it.

03:26
Now, type the following - "Reduce cost, Reduce dependence on few vendors, Develop customized applications".

03:37
Changing the font type and font size are the same as in LibreOffice Writer documents.

03:43
Select a line of text. In the Text Format tool bar, change the Font type from “Albany” to “Arial Black”

03:52
and the font size from “32” to “40”.

03:56
Click anywhere outside the text-box.

03:59
Notice that the font has changed.

04:02
We can  also change the font by clicking on Format in the main menu and the Character option.

04:09
This opens up a dialog-box in which we can set the Font, Style and Size as per our requirement.

04:16
Let's close this dialog-box.

04:19
To change the color of the font, we will choose the slide titled "Development up to present".

04:25
Click on the body text-box and select all the text.

04:30
Click on the downward-arrow, next to the font color icon, and select the colour you want.

04:37
Click anywhere outside the text-box.

04:40
Notice the change in the colour.

04:43
Formatting like Bold, Italics and Underline are the same as in LibreOffice Writer documents.
