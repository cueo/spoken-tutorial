Welcome to the tutorial on LibreOffice Impress - Viewing a Presentation.

00:06
In this tutorial, we will learn about:
View options and their uses and Master Pages.

00:13
Here, we are using:
Ubuntu Linux 10.04 and   LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

00:22
First, let us open our presentation “Sample Impress” by double-clicking on it.

00:27
LibreOffice Impress has many view options that help you create a better presentation.

00:34
By default, when you start LibreOffice Impress, it looks like this.

00:41
This is called the Normal view.

00:43
When the presentation is in any other view,

00:48
you can return to the Normal view by clicking on the Normal tab <PAUSE>

00:53
or by clicking on View and Normal.

00:57
In the Normal view, you can create and edit slides.

01:02
For example, we can change the design of the slides.

01:05
To do this, go to the slide titled "Overview".

01:09
On the right side, in the Tasks pane, Master Pages section, under "Used in This Presentation", we can see the slide design is 'prs strategy'.

01:21
Under this, we can see Recently Used and Available for Use slide designs.

01:27
Click on any one of your choice.

01:30
Notice the change in the slide design in the Workspace pane.

01:35
See, how easy it is to change the slide design?

01:39
You can also add designs that you have created as background for your slides.

01:45
Next, we will see the Outline view.

01:47
You can go to this view either by clicking on View and Outline <PAUSE>

01:53
or by clicking on the Outline tab.

01:57
In this view, you can see that the slides are arranged one below the other - just like a Table of Contents.

02:05
These here, are the slide headings.

02:08
Notice that the slide heading "Overview" is highlighted.

02:12
This is because we were on the Overview slide when we selected the Outline tab.

02:18
You can see these icons shaped like bullet points.

02:23
When you hover the mouse over these bullet points, the cursor turns into a hand.

02:29
We can then move these line items up or down in order to rearrange them within a slide <PAUSE>

02:38
or across slides.

02:40
Let us undo these changes by pressing Ctrl and Z so that our presentation appears in its original form.

02:49
We use the Slide Sorter view to rearrange slides.

02:53
We can get to the Slide Sorter view by clicking on View and Slide Sorter <PAUSE>

03:00
or by clicking on the Slide Sorter tab.

03:04
This view is useful to sort the slides in the desired order.

03:08
For example - To interchange slide number 9 and 10, click on slide number 10 and drag the slide before slide number 9.

03:18
Now, release the mouse button. <PAUSE>

03:22
The slides get interchanged!

03:26
In the Notes view, you can write notes that will help you during your presentation.

03:31
To go to the Notes view, click on View and then Notes Page.

03:36
You can also click on the Notes tab.

03:39
Select the slide "Development up to present" from the Slides pane.

03:44
Type some text in the notes portion.

03:49
When your slides are viewed on a projector, you will still be able to see your notes on your monitor but your audience won’t.

03:58
Now, let’s click on the Normal tab.

04:01
We can change the layout of the presentation in the Tasks pane, Layouts section, on the right.

04:08
To show or hide the Tasks pane,

04:12
click on View and Tasks Pane.

04:14
This will either show or hide the Tasks pane.

04:18
Let’s use the Layout section to change the layout of a slide.

04:23
Select the slide named "Development up to present".

04:26
From the Layout section, select Title Content over Content.

04:33
This changes the layout of the slide.

04:37
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

04:40
