03:07
Click on the Body text-box and type the titles of the succeeding slides as follows:

03:14

Now, when you hover the cursor over the text, the cursor turns into a pointing finger.

04:21
This means that the hyperlinking was successful!

04:25
Clicking on the hyperlinked text takes you to the relevant slide.

04:30
To hyperlink to another document, let's go back to the 'Table of Contents' slide.

04:36

06:23
Click anywhere on the slide.

06:26

This means that the hyperlinking was successful!

06:37
Now, clicking on the hyperlinked text takes you to the relevant web-page.

Lastly, tables are used to organize data into columns and rows.

06:49

and reduce the font-size to 26.

07:17
In the right side text-box, click on the icon Insert Table from the Insert toolbar in the centre.

07:25
By default, Number of columns is displayed as 5 and Number of rows is displayed as 2.

07:34
We will change the Number of columns to 2 and the Number of rows to 5.

07:42
Click on the OK button.

07:44
Let's elongate the table so that the text is readable.

07:49
Enter data into the table as shows-

07:52
"Implementation Year" and "%" (percentage)

07:56
2006  10%

07:59
2007  20%

08:02
2008  30%

08:05
2009  40%

08:08
Now, let's change the font of the header row to bold and center the text.

08:18
To change the color of the table, first select all the text.

08:22
Then from the Table Design section on the Tasks pane, select a table style. I will select this one.

08:31
