Welcome to the spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Impress - Creating a presentation document and basic formatting.

00:09
In this tutorial, we will learn about-
 The parts of the Impress window and 
 How to: insert slides, copy slides, about fonts and formatting of fonts.


00:21
Here we are using GNU Linux as our operating system and LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

00:30
Let's open our presentation “Sample Impress” that we created in the previous tutorial.

00:36
Let's take a tour of what is on the screen.

00:40
In the centre, we see the workspace which is our working area.

00:44
As you can see, the “Workspace” has 5 tabs called the View buttons.

00:50
Currently the Normal tab is selected.

00:53
This is the main view for creating individual slides.

00:56
The Outline view shows topic titles, bulleted and numbered lists for each slide in outline format.

01:03
The Notes view lets you add notes to each slide that are not seen when the presentation is shown.

01:10
The Handout view allows to print the slides for a handout.

01:14
Here, we can choose the number of slides that we want to print per page.

01:19
The Slide Sorter view shows thumbnails of the slides.

01:23
Let's click on the Normal view button again.

01:26
On the left hand side of the screen, you see the “Slides” pane. It contains thumbnails of the slides in the presentation.

01:35
On the right hand side, you see the “Tasks” pane which has 5 sections.

01:41
The Layouts section has pre-packaged layouts.

01:44
We can use these directly or modify them as per our requirements.

01:49
We should see each of these sections in detail as we progress through the tutorial series.

 01:55
Now, let's learn how to insert a slide. Select the second slide, in the “Slides” pane, by clicking on it.

02:02
Now we click on Insert and Slide.

02:06
We see that a new blank slide has been inserted after the second slide.

02:11
To add a title to the slide, click on the text bar that says Click to add Title.

02:18
Now, type: "Short Term Strategy" and click outside the text-box.

02:24
So, a title can be added in this way.

02:27
There are two ways in which we can make a copy of a slide.

02:31
Let’s look at the first way- Click on Insert and Duplicate Slide.

02:36
We can see that a new duplicate slide has been inserted after the one we created in the previous step.

02:43
Alternately, go to the slide sorter view by clicking on the Slide Sorter tab in the “Workspace” pane.

02:51
Now, copy the 7th slide by right-clicking on it and selecting Copy from the context menu.

02:58
Right-click on the last slide and select Paste.

03:02
Select After and click OK.

03:05
You have now created a copy of the slide at the end of the presentation!

03:11
Now, let’s look at fonts and some of the ways that you can format fonts.

03:16
Select the slide titled Long term goal by double-clicking on it.

03:21
Click on the Body text-box and select all the text. Now delete it.

03:27
Now, type the following: "Reduce cost, Reduce dependence on few vendors, Develop customized applications".

03:38
Changing the font type and font size are the same as in LibreOffice Writer documents.

03:44
Select a line of text. In the Text Format tool bar, change the Font type from “Albany” to “Arial Black”

03:53
and the font-size from “32” to “40”.

03:57
Click anywhere outside the text-box.

04:00
Notice that the font has changed.

04:03
We can  also change the font by clicking on Format in the main menu and the Character option.

04:10
This opens up a dialog-box in which we can set the Font, Style and Size as per our requirement.

04:17
Let's close this dialog-box.

04:20
To change the color of the font, we will choose the slide titled "Development up to present".

04:26
Click on the body text box and select all the text.

04:31
Click on the downward-arrow next to the font color icon and select the colour you want.

04:38
Click anywhere outside the text-box.

04:41
Notice the change in the colour.

04:44
Formatting like Bold, Italics and Underline are the same as in LibreOffice Writer documents.

04:51
Select the slide titled "Recommendations".

04:54
Click on the Body text-box and select a line of text.

04:59
Now click on the Bold, Italics and Underline icons.

05:04
Click anywhere outside the text-box.

05:07

05:09
