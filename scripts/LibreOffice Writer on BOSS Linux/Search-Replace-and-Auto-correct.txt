 Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Writer – using Find and Replace feature and the AutoCorrect feature in Writer.

00:09
 In this tutorial, we will learn the following:

00:12
* Find and Replace

00:14
* Spellcheck

00:15
* AutoCorrect.

00:17
 Here, we are using GNU/ Linux as our operating system and  LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

00:26
 Now, let us start by learning about the Find and Replace button in the Writer.

00:32
It searches for text and/or replaces text in the entire document.

00:36
 Let us learn more about it through an example.

00:40
So, first open our 'resume.odt' file.

00:44
 Now, click on the Edit option and then click on Find and Replace.

00:51
Alternately, click on the button in the standard tool bar.

00:56
You see a dialog-box appears with a  Search for and a Replace with fields.

01:01
 Enter the text that you want to search for, in the Search for field.

01:06
For example, we have to search for all the places where "Ramesh" is written in our document.

01:12
So, type "Ramesh" in the Search For field.

01:15
Now, click on  Find All.

01:19
 You see that all the places where "Ramesh" is written, in our document, get highlighted.

01:25
 Enter the text that you want to replace this with, in the Replace with field.

01:31
For example, we want to replace "Ramesh" with "MANISH" in our document.

01:37
So, we type "Manish" in the Replace with tab.

01:41
Now, click on Replace All.

01:44
 You see that everywhere "Ramesh" in our document gets replaced with "Manish".

01:51
At the bottom of the dialog-box, we see a More Options button. Click on it.

01:57
 The More Options button contains a list of specific Find and Replace options.

02:03
It has options like  Backwards which searches for the text from bottom to top, Current selection only which searches for text inside the selected portion of the text.

02:15
It has other advanced options like Regular expressions, Search for Styles and a few more.

02:26
 There are three more options on the right hand side of the dialog-box.

02:31
They are Attributes, Format and No Format.

02:36
They provide users with various types of advanced Find and Replace options.

02:41
Let us close this.

02:44
We will learn more about them in more advanced tutorials.

02:48
 After learning about Find and Replace feature, we will now learn about how to check spellings in LibreOffice Writer using Spellcheck.

02:57
 Spellcheck is used for checking the spelling mistakes in the entire document or the selected portion of text.

03:05
 The spellcheck starts at the current cursor position and advances to the end of the document or selection.

03:12
You can then choose to continue the spellcheck from the beginning of the document.

03:17
 'Spellcheck' looks for spelling mistakes in words and gives you the option of adding an unknown word to a user dictionary.

03:26
 Let us see how it is implemented.

03:29
 The 'spell check' feature is distinct for each language.

03:33
For example, click on the Tools option in the menu bar and then click on Options.

03:39
In the dialog-box which appears, click on the Language Settings option and finally click on Languages.

03:47
 Under the option User interface, make sure that the default option is set as English (USA).

03:56
Below that, click on the down-arrow in the  Locale setting field and then click on the English (USA) option.

04:03
Now, under the heading Default languages for documents, the default language set in the Western field is English (India).

04:12
Since English (India) may not have the dictionary required by spell check, we will change the language to English (USA).

04:21
So, click on the down-arrow in the Western field and click on the English (USA) option.

04:27
Finally, click on the OK button.

04:31
 So, we are now ready to see how the spellcheck feature works for the language- English (USA).

04:38
 To use the Spelling and Grammar feature, make sure that the AutoSpellCheck option is enabled.

04:45
So, let us click on the AutoSpellCheck button in the toolbar, if it is not enabled.

04:52
In our 'resume.odt' file, under "Mother’s Occupation",  we shall type a wrong spelling for "housewife" in the sentence as "husewife" and press the space-bar.

05:05
You see that a red line appears just below the incorrect word.

05:10
Now, place the cursor on the word "husewife" and click on the Spelling and Grammar icon in the standard tool bar.

05:18
So, we see the word in the Not in dictionary field.

05:22
 The word with the wrong spelling is highlighted in red and there are several suggestions for the correct word in the Suggestions box from where you can choose the correct word.

05:34
 In the suggestion box, click on the word "housewife" and then click on the Change button.

05:40
Click on OK in the small dialog-box that appears.

05:44
You see that the correct spelling now appears in the document.

05:48
Let us undo the changes.

05:50
 Let us now learn about another standard tool-bar option called AutoCorrect.

05:56
The AutoCorrect feature is an extension of Spellcheck.

06:00
 AutoCorrect is found in the drop-down menu of the Format option, in the menu bar.

06:06
 AutoCorrect automatically formats the file according to the options that you set.

06:12
These options are selected by clicking on the AutoCorrect Options.

06:18
 The AutoCorrect dialog-box will open.

06:21
AutoCorrect feature, automatically corrects text as you write.

06:26
The corrections are made according to the options you have selected in the Options tab.

06:32
 There are several AutoCorrect options like "Delete spaces at the end and beginning of paragraph", "Ignore double spaces" and many more.

06:44
 So, let us see how they work through an example.

06:48
 In our 'resume' file, we shall type some text with single spaces in between words at few places and double and triple spaces between words, at other places.

07:02
 Select the entire text now.

07:05
 Click on Format button on the menu bar.

07:09
 Then click on AutoCorrect in the drop-down menu and finally click on AutoCorrect Options in the sub-menu.

07:17
 Click on the Options tab.

07:20
Now, put a check on "Ignore double spaces" and click on OK button.

07:26
 The next text which you type, doesn’t allow you to have double spaces in between words automatically.

07:34
Let us place the cursor after the name "MANISH". Now, press the space-bar on the keyboard twice.

07:41
You see that the cursor only moves one place and doesn’t allow double spaces in the text.

07:48
After the single space, type the surname as "KUMAR".

07:53
 AutoCorrect also has the ability to replace a word or an abbreviation with a more significant or longer text.

08:02
It saves typing effort by creating shortcuts to long words.

08:09
 For example- in our 'resume.odt' file, there might be a few set of words or word which are used repeatedly in the document.

08:19
It can be cumbersome to type these sentences or words again and again.

08:24
Let's say we want to type the text "This is a Spoken Tutorial Project" repeatedly in our document.

08:31
Then we can create an abbreviation which will directly get converted into our required text.

08:38
 So, let us see how an abbreviation like 'stp' gets automatically converted to "Spoken Tutorial Project".

08:46
 Now, click on the Format option in the menu bar then go to the AutoCorrect option and then click on the AutoCorrect Options.

08:57
In the dialog-box that appears, click on the Replace tab.

09:02
 Check that English (USA) is our language choice.

09:06
Now, in the Replace field, let us type the abbreviation which we want to replace as 'stp'.

09:14
In the With field, we type the replaced text as "Spoken Tutorial Project".

09:20
Click on the New button in the dialog-box.

09:24
You see that the entry is made in the replacement table.

09:28
Now, click on the OK button.

09:31
 Now, as soon as we write the text "This is a stp" and press the space-bar,  you will notice that  the 'stp' abbreviation gets converted to "Spoken Tutorial Project".

09:43
This feature is very helpful when the same text is repeated several times in a document.

09:49
Let us undo the changes.

09:52
 This brings us to the end of this spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Writer.
