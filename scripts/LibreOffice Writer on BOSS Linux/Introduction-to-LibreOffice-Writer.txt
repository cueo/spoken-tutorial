LibreOffice Writer is the word processor component of the LibreOffice Suite.

00:27
It is the equivalent of Microsoft Word in Microsoft Office Suite.

0:33
It is a free and open source software. So, it can be shared, modified and distributed without any restrictions.

00:41
Since it is free to share, it can be shared without needing to pay any license fees.

00:47
To get started with 'LibreOffice suite', you can use either Microsoft Windows 2000 and its higher versions like MS Windows XP or MS Windows 7 or you can use GNU/Linux as your Operating System.

01:04
Here, we are using GNU/Linux  as our operating system

01:11
and LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

01:16
If you do not have LibreOffice Suite installed, Writer can be installed by using Synaptic Package Manager.

01:24
For more information on 'Synaptic Package Manager', please refer to the Linux Tutorials and download 'LibreOffice Suite' by following the instructions on this website.

01:37
Detailed instructions are available in the first tutorial of 'LibreOffice Suite'.

01:43
Remember, when installing, use the Complete option to install Writer.

01:50
If you have already installed LibreOffice Suite,  you will find LibreOffice Writer by clicking on the Applications option at the top left corner of your screen

02:02
and then clicking on Office and then on the LibreOffice option.

02:08
A new dialog-box opens up with various LibreOffice components.

02:13
In order to access LibreOffice Writer, click on the “Text Document” option which is the word processor component of the suite.

02:23
This will open an empty document in the main 'Writer' window.

02:28
The Writer window has various tool bars like- the title bar,

02:33
the menu bar,  the standard toolbar,

02:36
the formatting bar and the status bar which have the most commonly used options which we will learn about as the tutorials progress.

02:47
Now, let us start the tutorial by learning how to open a new document in Writer.

02:53
You can open a new document by clicking on the New icon in the standard toolbar

03:00
or by clicking on the File option in the menu bar

03:05
and then clicking on the New option and then finally clicking on the Text document option.

03:12
You see that a new 'Writer' window opens up in both the cases.

03:17
Now, type some text in the editor area.

03:21
So, we will type: "RESUME".

03:24
Once done writing your document, you should save it for future use.

03:29
To save this file, click on File in the menu bar

03:33
and then click on the Save As option.

 03:36
A new dialog-box appears on the screen where you are required to enter the name of your file under the "Name:" field.

03:44
So, enter the name of the file as "resume".

03:48
Below the “Name” field, you have the “Save in folder” field where you are required to enter the folder name which will contain your saved file.

03:58
So, click on the down-arrow in the “Save in folder” field.

04:02
You see a list of folders appears in the menu where you can save your file.

04:08
Now, let us click on the Desktop option. The file will be saved on the desktop.

04:14
You can also click on "Browse for other folders"

04:18
and choose the folder in which you want to save your document.

04:23
Now, click on the File type option in the dialog-box.

04:27
It shows you a list of 'File type' options or 'file extensions' under which you can save your file.

04:34
The default file type in LibreOffice Writer is the “ODF Text Document” which provides the extension dot odt.

04:45
"ODT" belongs to the Open Document Format or the ODF format which is a globally accepted open standard for word documents.

04:56
It is also accepted by the Government of India policy on open standards in e-Governance.

05:04
Besides saving as dot odt text documents which can be opened in LibreOffice Writer,

05:11
you can also save your file as dot doc and as dot docx format which can be opened in the MS Office Word program.

05:23
Another popular file extension which opens in most programs is dot rtf which is the “Rich Text Format”.

05:33
Now, click on the “ODF Text Document” option.

05:37
You see that the file type: “ODF Text Document” and within brackets dot “odt”, gets displayed next to the File type option.

05:48
Now click on the Save button.

05:50
This takes you back to the 'Writer' window with the filename and the extension of your choice, on the title bar.

05:58
You are now ready to write a text document in Writer window.

06:03
In addition to the formats discussed  above, the Writer documents can also be saved in dot html format which is a web-page format.

06:13
This is done in the same way as explained before .

06:17
So, click on the File option in the menu bar and then click on the Save As option.

06:24
Now click on the File Type option and then click on the HTML Document and within braces Open Office dot org Writer option.

06:35
This option gives the dot html extension to the document.

06:40
Click on the Save button.

06:42
Now put a check on the "Ask when not saving in ODF format" option in the dialog-box.

06:50
Finally, click on the “Keep Current Format” option.

06:55
You see that the document gets saved with dot html extension.

07:00
The document can also be exported to "PDF" format by simply clicking on the “Export Directly as PDF” option in the standard tool bar.

07:10
As before, choose the location where you wish to save.

07:15
Alternately, you can do so by clicking on the File option in the menu bar and then clicking on the “Export as pdf” option.

07:24
In the dialog-box which appears, click on Export and after that click on the Save button.

07:32
A 'pdf' file will be created.

07:35
Let's close this document by clicking on File and then Close.

07:40
Next, we will learn how to open an existing document in LibreOffice Writer.

07:47
Let's open the document "Resume.odt".

07:51
To open an existing document, click on the File menu in the menu bar at the top and then click on the Open option.

08:00
You see that a dialog-box appears on the screen.

08:04
Here, find the folder where you saved your document.

08:08
So, click on the small pencil button at the top left corner of the dialog-box.

08:14
It has the name: “Type a file Name”.

08:16
This opens a "Location" Bar field.

08:19
Here, type the name of the file you are looking for.

08:24
So, we write the name of the file as “resume”.

08:27
Now, the list which appears with "resume" as file name, choose resume dot odt.

08:34
Now, click on the Open button.

08:37
You see that the file "resume.odt" opens.

08:41
Alternately, you can open an existing file by clicking on the Open icon in the toolbar, at the top, and doing the further process in the same manner.

08:52
You can also open files in Writer with dot doc and dot docx extensions which are used by Microsoft Word.

09:03
Next, you will see how to modify a file and save it under the same file name.

09:10
So, first select the text "RESUME" by clicking on the left mouse button and then dragging it along the text.

09:17
This will select the text and highlight it. Now release the left-mouse-button.

09:24
The text should still be highlighted.

09:26
Now, click on the Bold icon in the standard toolbar.  The text thus becomes bold.

09:33
In order to align this text to the centre of the page, click on the Centered icon in the toolbar.

09:41
You see that the text gets centrally aligned on the page.

09:45
Now, let us increase the font-size of the text.

09:48
So, click on the down-arrow in the “Font Size” field in the toolbar.

09:53
In the drop down menu,let us click on “14”.

09:57
So, the font-size of the text increases to “14”.

10:01
Now, click on the down-arrow in the Font Name field and then select UnDotum as the font name.

10:09
Click on the Save icon in the toolbar.

10:13
So, you see that the file gets saved under the same file name even after the modification is done.

10:21
Once you have saved your document and you wish to close it,

10:25
just click on the File menu in the menu bar and click on the Close option. This closes your file.
