 Hello Everybody.

 00:03
 Welcome to the tutorial on LibreOffice Writer - Track changes while Editing a document.

00:09
 In this tutorial, I will explain how peer review of documents can be done with LibreOffice Writer.

 00:16
 We will open an existing document to explain how to peer review and edit a document using Record Changes option.

00:26
The benefit in using this feature is that a reviewer can give comments, add text, delete or modify existing text which is clearly visible as such, in the same document.

00:40
  This can be easily seen by the author who can accept or reject these changes and thus incorporate these edit comments without the effort of making the changes once again.

00:53
And when the file is saved, the comments are incorporated.

 00:57
 So, let's learn how to do all of this.

01:02
 Here, we are using:
 Linux as an operating system and
 LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4. 


01:10
 In this tutorial, I will be using some documents that I have already created and saved on my system, namely-

 01:16
* "Seven-reasons-to-adopt-FOSS.odt"

 01:20
* "Government-support-for-FOSS-in-India.odt".

01:24
 click on Applications  >> Office  and >> LibreOffice Writer to start Writer.

 01:34
  Open "Seven-reasons-to-adopt-FOSS.odt".

 01:41
To set the Record changes option on, go to Edit â†’ Changes and check the Record option.

 01:53
 The Show option should also be checked. This will enable any subsequent editing to be recorded distinctly.

02:01
 In the document, let us insert a second point.

 02:05
 We will go to point number 2 and type:  "Linux is a virus resistant operating system since each user has a distinct data space and cannot directly access the program files".

 02:36
 Hit Enter so that the current second point becomes point number 3.

 02:42
Note that the text input has come in a new color.

02:46
 Hover the mouse over this text. You will see the message "Inserted sriranjani:" followed by date and time of insertion.

 02:55
 Thus the person making the comment is identified in the document. The name is provided based on the name given during installation of LibreOffice as the user on the computer.

03:08
  Correct the spelling of avalable in this first line. You will notice the correction.

03:17
Delete the first point - "It can be installed on all computers without restriction or needing to pay license fees to vendors".

 03:31
 Note that the deletion does not actually delete the line but marks it as a line suggested for deletion.

 03:39
 Hover the cursor over it and we see the message Deleted SriRanjani: followed by date and time of deletion .

03:49
 In this manner, modifications can be made to a document by adding, deleting or changing an existing text in a document.

04:00
More than one person can edit the same document.

 04:04
 LO Writer will show each edit in a different colour to help the reader distinguish one reviewer's work from another.

 04:13
 Of course, hovering the mouse over the edited text will display the name of the reviewer.

 04:19
  I am going to demonstrate this by opening a document which has already been edited by my colleague Guru.

 04:27
 Open a text file document- "Government-support-for-FOSS-in-India.odt".

 04:35
 In this document, we can see that several additions and deletions have been done.

 04:42
 Hovering the mouse over this text gives the message that the addition and deletion have been done by Guru.

 04:52
 Add a point at the bottom "CDAC, NIC, NRC-FOSS are institutions of Government of India which develop and promote FOSS".

 05:18
We can see that the colour of this insertion is different from the colour of the edits done by Guru.

 05:24
 Hovering the mouse over this insertion gives the message Inserted: SriRanjani.

 05:29
 Thus, more than one person can edit the same document before it goes back to the author.

 05:34
 Close the document without saving it.

  05:45
 We will now show how the author can accept or reject changes made by the reviewer.

 05:50
 In the same document, "Government-support-for-FOSS-in-India.odt", let's assume that I am the author and I will accept or reject the edits made by Guru.

 06:12
 Go to point number 2 and right-click on the deleted text "reasons" and say Accept Change.

 06:22
 You will see that the text gets deleted which is the change suggested by the reviewer.

 06:28
 Right-click on the inserted text "needs" and select Accept Change. You will see that the text becomes normal which is the change suggested by the reviewer.

 06:39
In this way, edits suggested by the reviewer, both insertions and deletions, can be accepted by the author.

 06:49
 Go to point number 1 and right-click on the deleted text: "The OpenOffice document standard (ODF) has been notified under this policy" and select Reject Change.

 07:01
 This makes the text normal i.e. the suggestion of the reviewer to delete, has been rejected by the author.

 07:09
  Go to point number 5 and right-click on "Government Schools in these states and in Orissa, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu learn Linux" and select Reject Change.

 07:24
 This deletes the text inserted by the reviewer.

 07:27
 In this manner, each addition or deletion can be accepted or rejected by the author.

07:34
  Finally, after accepting or rejecting changes, we should go to Edit >> Changes and uncheck the Record and Show options.

 07:56
 When unchecked, any further editing will not be marked separately.

 08:00
 Please be sure to save the file after accepting or rejecting changes to incorporate all comments given by the reviewers.

08:09
  This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Finally, the ASSIGNMENT-

 08:16
 Open a document and make corrections to spelling mistakes in the Record Changes mode.
