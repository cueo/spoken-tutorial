 LibreOffice Writer allows you to add page numbers to a document.

00:38

 Now click on the Insert option in the menu bar and then click on the Footer option.

00:58
 Next, click on the Default option.

 We see that the Edit Fields: Document dialog-box appears on the screen.

01:41
 Under the Format option, you see many formats like A B C in uppercase, a b c in lowercase, Arabic 1 2 3 and many more.

01:53
 Here, you can choose the page numbering style that you prefer.

01:58
 We will choose  Roman i, ii, iii option and then click on the OK button.

02:05
 You see that the numbering format changes for the page.

02:09

02:58
 Now, click on the File menu in the menu bar and then click on the Page preview option.

03:05
 Let us zoom the document to 50%.

03:15
 This will be replicated on all the pages of the document.

03:19
 To get back to the original document, click on the Close Preview button.

03:40
 Select the Footer tab in the dialog-box.

03:52
 To add a border or a shadow to the footer, click on the More option first and then set the value of the options you want to put into the footer.

04:03

06:27
 Footnotes appear at the bottom of the page on which they are referenced

06:31
 whereas Endnotes are collected at the end of a document.

06:35
 The anchor for the note is inserted at the current cursor position.

 Numbering allows you to select the type of numbering that you want to use for footnotes and endnotes.

08:03
 To assign a special character, click on the button below the character field.

08:09
 Now, click on any of the special characters you want to insert and then click on the OK button.

08:17
 Click on either Footnote or Endnote option under the Type heading to specify our choice.

08:24
 So, we will select Automatic under Numbering and Footnote under Type.

08:29
 Now, click on the OK button.

08:32

08:39
