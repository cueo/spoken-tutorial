 Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Writer- Creating Newsletters with Multiple Columns.

00:07
 In this tutorial, we will learn how to create newsletters in LibreOffice Writer and a few operations that can be performed on them.

00:17
 Here, we are using:
Ubuntu Linux 10.04 as our operating system and
LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4. 

00:27
 A newsletter is used as a publication which gets circulated out to its subscribers in a regular time interval. For example - a periodical, a pamphlet and many more.

00:39
It has multiple columns as sections and makes it easier for the reader to go through different articles in these sections.

00:47
 Using LibreOffice Writer, one can create newsletters which make reading of articles much easier and faster.

00:55
Let's open a new text document by clicking on File, New and Text Document option.

01:03
 Save this document with file name Newsletter.

01:13
 So, we have a new text document named Newsletter.

01:17
 Now, let's insert columns into our document.

01:20
To do so, first click on the Format button in the menu bar and then click on Columns.

01:27
 A dialog-box appears with various options -

01:31
selecting the number of columns you want,

01:34
setting the width and spacing of these columns

01:37
as well as setting the various properties of the separator lines.

01:42
 We will select two columns for the newsletter document by increasing the column field value to 2.

01:49
 The five icons besides the column field show you the preview of the various formats available.

01:56
 So, let's click on the second format.

01:59
Let's keep all the other values which define the property of the columns as default.

02:05
And click on the OK button.

02:08
 You see that 2 columns get displayed in the text area.

02:12
 Let us write an article in our first column.

02:15
We will give its heading as "Nature" in bold text with font size 15.

02:21
And below that, we will write an article on it.

02:25
 You see that the cursor automatically goes to the next column after it reaches the end of the first column.

02:33
 You can even insert a picture in the column and resize it so that it fits into the column.

02:39
 Now, after leaving out some spaces, you can write another article into the column.

02:46
 So, we will first give it a heading as Sports in bold text with font size 15 and below that we will write an article on it.

02:56
 So, you see, columns make it easier for the reader to go through multiple articles.

03:02
 Let us delete some sentences so that our article fits in the first column only.

03:08
 Then, to access the further columns, click on the Insert button and then click on Manual Break.

03:16
 In the dialog-box which appears, click on the Column break button and then click on the OK button.

03:23
 You see that the cursor comes on the next column automatically.

03:27
So, you can start writing another article in this column.

03:31
 All the formatting options like-

03:33
Align left, Align right,

03:36
adding Background Color to the text,

03:38
Highlighting the text and many other features

03:41
can be added to the text to make it attractive.

03:45
 For example, we select the portion of the text to which we want to apply a background color.

03:51
Now, click on the Background Color icon in the toolbar and then click on Green 4.

03:59
We see that the background color of the selected text changes to light green.

04:05
 Likewise you can give different background colors to different parts of the text.

04:10
 You can even add banners to the newsletter by first clicking on the Text option in the Drawing toolbar.

04:18
 Now, place the text-box anywhere in the document where there is no written text.

04:24
Inside the text-box, you can write any text which will act as a banner or ads.

04:30
 So, let us type some text like: "This is a newsletter".

04:35
 You can even add effects to this text.

04:37
For example- first, right-click on the text and then click on the Text option in the menu.

04:45
 A dialog-box appears which has tabs namely Text and Text Animation.

04:50
Click on the Text Animation tab.

04:53
 In the Effect field, under this tab, there are various options.

04:58
 In order to blink the text in the newsletter, we click on the Blink option

05:04
and finally click on the OK button.

05:07
 We see that the text "This is a newsletter" constantly blinks in the document.

05:13
Similarly, various such effects and graphics can be given to the text.

05:18
 Now, for writing a new article on the next page, you need to first click on the Insert button

05:25
and then click on the Manual Break option.

05:29
 In the dialog-box which appears, click on the Page break button.

05:34
And finally click on the OK button.

05:37
 You see that the cursor comes on the next page.

05:40
This page contains the same column format as on the previous page.

05:46
 For maintaining a word count in your article, first  select a portion of your text or the entire document.

05:53
Now, click on the Tools option in the menu bar.

05:57
 Now, click on the Word Count option in the drop-down box.

06:02
 A dialog-box appears which shows you the word count of Current selection and the Whole document as well.

06:10
It also shows the total count of characters in your entire document as well as in the selected text.

06:18
 The spell check can be done automatically while writing the document.

06:23
Click on the AutoSpellcheck icon in the toolbar.

06:27
 Now, while writing the article, if there are any spelling mistakes  then 'Writer' automatically shows them by underlining the word with a red line.

06:37
For example, when we write the word  Cat as C -A- A -T and press the space-bar, we see that a red line is displayed below it.

06:48
 But, when we correct the word, the red line disappears.

06:52
 Hence, we see that all the formatting options discussed in the previous tutorials can be applied in the newsletters too.

07:01
