Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Writer-Inserting images.

00:06
In this tutorial, we will learn the following:

00:09
 Inserting an image file into a document.

00:12
 Inserting tables in Writer.

00:15
 Inserting hyperlinks in Writer.

00:18
Here, we are using:
Ubuntu Linux 10.04 as our operating system and
LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

00:29
We will start by learning how to insert an image file in LibreOffice Writer.

00:36
Let us open our 'resume.odt' file.

00:39
In order to insert an image into the document, first click inside the resume.odt document.

00:47
Now click on the Insert option in the menu bar, then click on Picture and finally click on From File option.

00:56
You see that an Insert picture dialog-box appears.

01:00
Now you can select a picture if you have saved it on your system by writing the name of the file in the Location field.

01:09
Since we have not saved any, we will insert a picture from among the options which are provided by default.

01:16
So, click on the Pictures option on the left hand side of the dialog-box.

01:21
Now, click on one of the images and finally click on the Open button.

01:28
You see that the image gets inserted into your document.

01:32
You can resize this image and drag it to the top right corner of the resume.

01:38
So, click on the image first. You see that colored handles appear on the image.

01:44
Place the cursor on one of the handles and press the left mouse button.

01:50
Resize the image by dragging the cursor. After the resizing is done, click on the image and drag it to the top right corner of the editor.

02:01
Other popular methods of inserting images are by using clipboard or scanner and from the gallery.

02:09
Next we will learn how to insert tables in Writer.

02:13
Tables in 'LibreOffice writer' enable users to store their information in a tabular form.

02:21
To insert a table into your document, you can either click on the Table icon in the toolbar and select the size of the table or you can do so through the Insert option in the menu bar.

02:36
So, in order to insert a table below the heading "Education Details", place the cursor below this heading.

02:44
Now, click on the Insert menu in the menu bar and then click on the Table option.

02:51
It opens up a dialog-box with several fields.

02:55
In the Name field, let us give the name of the table as "resume table".

03:01
Under the heading Size, let us keep the number of Columns as 2.

03:06
Click on the upward-arrow in the Rows field and increase the number of Rows to 4.

03:11
Hence you can increase or decrease the size of the  table using the up and the down arrows in the columns and rows fields.

03:21
Now, click on the AutoFormat button in the dialog-box.

03:25
This opens a new dialog-box where you can select the format of the table you want to insert.

03:33
Writer provides several options to choose from. We click on the Noneoption under Format and then click on the OK button.

03:43
Again click on the OK button.

03:45
You see that the table with two columns and four rows gets inserted below the heading.

03:53
Now we can write any information in tabular form inside the table.

03:58
For example, click inside the cell in the first row and first column of the table.

04:04
We type here "Secondary School Examination".

04:08
Now, click on the adjacent cell and write 93 percent. So, this shows that Ramesh scored 93 percent in the secondary school examination.

04:20
Likewise, we can type further educational details in the table.

04:25
Click on the cell just below the cell where we typed "Secondary School Examination".

04:31
We write here "Higher Secondary School Examination" and in the adjacent cell, we write the score as "88" percent.

04:41
Click on the first cell in the third row to access the next cell. Alternately, you may press the Tab key to move from cell-to- cell.

04:52
So, let's press Tab and type "Graduation". Type the score as "75%" in the adjacent cell.

05:01
Finally, in the last row, we type the heading as "Post Graduation" in the first cell and in the adjacent cell, the score as "70" percent.

05:12
So, we see that the table with education details is represented in the resume.

05:18
Let us place the cursor in the last cell of the table.

05:24
Now, if we want to add an additional row just below the last row of the table, press the Tab key on the keyboard.

05:33
You see that a new row gets inserted.

05:37
On the left hand side of the table, we type "Phd" as the degree attained and on the right hand side we type “65%” as the marks obtained.

05:49
So,we see that the Tab key is very useful in order to add new rows one below the other when the cursor is placed in the last cell.

06:00
Using Tab and Shift+Tab, one can also navigate from cell-to-cell within the table.

06:07
Another important feature in Tables is, the Optimal Column Width option which automatically adjusts the column widths according to the contents of the cells.

06:18
In order to apply this feature in the second or the right hand side column of the table, first click and place the cursor anywhere in the second column.

06:30
So, let us place the cursor after the text '65%' in the last cell.

06:35
Now, click on the Table menu in the menu bar and then go to the Autofit option.

06:42
In the menu which appears on the screen, click on the 'Optimal Column Width' option.

06:49
You see that the column width adjusts itself automatically, matching the content of the cells in the column.

06:58
Similarly, we can do this for any of the columns in a table.

07:02
You can set different kinds of borders for your table - from having no borders at all to having all inner and outer borders or only outer borders in your table etc.

07:15
For this, select Table tab in the main menu and Table Properties option, Borders tab to select appropriate option.

07:25
Next we will see how hyperlinks are created in Writer.

07:30
A user following hyperlinks is said to navigate or browse the hypertext.

07:35
A hyperlink is a reference to a document that the reader can directly follow or that is followed automatically.

07:43
A hyperlink points to a whole document or to a specific element within a document.

07:49
Before creating a hyperlink in the file, we first create a document to be hyperlinked.

07:56
So, click on the New icon in the toolbar.

08:00
A new text document opens. Now we create a table for hobbies in this new document.

08:06
So, we write the heading as "HOBBIES".

08:09
Press the Enter key.

08:11
Now, let us write few of the hobbies as "Listening to music", "Playing table tennis" and "Painting", one below the other.

08:20
Let us save this file.

08:24
Click on the Save icon in the toolbar. In the Name field, let us type the file name as "HOBBY".

08:30
Click on the down-arrow in the Save in folder and click on the Desktop option. Now, click on the Save button.

08:40
So, the file gets saved on the desktop.

08:43
We close this file now. Let us now create a hyperlink in the file 'resume.odt' which would open this document.

08:53
Now we write the heading as "HOBBIES", below the table containing educational details.

09:00
In order to make the text "HOBBIES" as a hyperlink, first select the text by dragging the cursor along the heading- "HOBBIES".

09:09
Now, click on the Insert menu in the menu bar and then click on the Hyperlink option.

09:15
A dialog-box opens which has options like Internet, Mails and news, Document and New Document.

09:24
Since we are creating a hyperlink for a text document, we click on the Document option.

09:30
Now click on the Open file button in the Path field .

09:36
Let us now click on the Desktop option in the dialog-box to access the new document which we had created.

09:44
Now, click on the 'hobby.odt' option and then click on the Open button.

09:52
You see that the path to the file gets inserted in the Path field.

09:57
Click on the Apply field and then click on the Close button.

10:02
You see that the text "HOBBIES" is underlined and is blue in color. Hence the text is now a hyperlink.

10:11
Now, place the cursor on the heading HOBBIES and press the Control key and the left mouse-button together.

10:19
You see that the file containing the hobbies opens up.

10:23
Similarly you can also create hyperlinks for images as well as websites.

10:30
