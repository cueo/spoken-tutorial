 Hello Everybody. Welcome to the tutorial - Typing in Local languages in LibreOffice Writer.

00:08
 In this tutorial, I will introduce you to text processing in Kannada with LibreOffice Writer.

00:15
Here, we are using:
Ubuntu Linux 10.04 as our operating system and
LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4. 

00:25
Now, I will explain how you can configure Kannada typing in LibreOffice. You can use this method to configure any language in LibreOffice.

00:36
Use Synaptic Package Manager to install packages.

00:40
For details, watch the tutorial on Synaptic Package Manager available on the Spoken Tutorial website.

00:48
The configuration is done in four steps -

00:52
 Check if SCIM is installed on your computer.

00:55
 If not, use the Synaptic Package Manager to mark the following packages and install SCIM.

01:03
 Pause this tutorial while you do this and resume when done.

01:08
 Next, select the SCIM-immodule as the keyboard input method.

01:14
 Configure 'SCIM' to select Kannada as a language for text input.

01:20
 Configure LibreOffice to select Kannada for Complex Text layout.

01:26
 I will now demonstrate these steps.

01:29
 Click on System, Administration and Language support.

01:41
 If you get a screen saying Remind Me Later or Install now, click on Remind me later.

01:51
In the Keyboard input method system, select scim-immodule.

01:56
 Here it is already selected. So, we will not do anything.

02:01
Thirdly, click on System, Preferences and SCIM Input Method to configure SCIM.

02:14
 You cannot see it on the screen right now. But, when you try this on your computer, you will be able to see this option.

02:22
 Under IMEngine, click on Global Setup.

02:27
 SCIM will show a list with all the languages it supports text processing in.

02:38
 This includes most widely spoken Indian languages including Hindi, Kannada, Bengali, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Urdu etc.

02:48
For our tutorial Hindi and Kannada should be selected.

02:55
Click OK to save your configuration.

02:59
 We will have to restart the machine to ensure that SCIM changes have taken effect.

03:04
 Please do so and return back to this tutorial.

03:08
 Now we will configure Kannada processing in LibreOffice.

03:14
 Click on Applications, Office and LibreOffice Writer.

03:27
 We will click on Tools in the main menu and Options sub-option.

03:33
 You will see the Options dialog-box.

03:37
In this box, we will click on Language Settings and then Languages option.

03:46
 Click on the check-box Enabled for complex text layout, if it is not already checked.

03:53
Please select Kannada from the CTL drop-down.

04:00
By default, this will set your local language setting to Kannada.

04:04
 Click on OK.

04:10
We will now type a sentence in Kannada and English.

04:15
 We will use Baraha method, the Nudi method and the UNICODE fonts. We will finally save the file.

04:24
Let me demonstrate this now.

04:27
In the opened text document, let's type: "Ubuntu GNU/Linux supports multiple languages with LibreOffice."

04:45
Hold the 'Control' key and hit the space bar.

04:52
A small window opens at the bottom right of the screen.

04:56
 Select Kannada > kn-itrans for inputting text in simple phonetic method which is similar to the Baraha method.

05:05
 If you want to Nudi keyboard layout, click on the Kannada > kn- kgp.

05:10
I will use kn-itrans input method which is simple and therefore easier for beginners.

05:16
Type "Sarvajanika Tantramsha" in English.

05:27
 You will see the Kannada text being displayed on the screen.

05:31
Hold the 'Control' Key and hit the space bar.

05:33
The window disappears.

05:35
We can now type in English.

05:37
Thus Control key plus space bar acts as a toggle between English and the other language selected.

05:48
 Please refer to the document on Kannada text processing available at www.Public-Software.in/Kannada for specific information about typing in Kannada, including typing in Nudi, using arkavathu.

06:05
We shall use only UNICODE font while typing in Indian languages since UNICODE is the universally accepted font.

06:13
Lohit Kannada is the UNICODE font that I am using.

06:16
Please note that I have shown you Kannada text processing.

06:20
The same procedure can be used to type text in any of the languages under SCIM Input Method using LibreOffice Writer.

06:28
Finally, the ASSIGNMENT-

06:31
Type a list of 3 books in Kannada.

06:33
Provide the English transliteration of the titles.

06:37
I have already constructed the assignment here.

06:42
