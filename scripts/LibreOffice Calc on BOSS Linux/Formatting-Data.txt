Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Calc – Formatting Data in Calc.

00:07
In this tutorial, we will learn about: * Formatting Borders, background colors.

00:14
* Formatting multiple lines of text using Automatic Wrapping.

00:19
* Merging Cells, Shrinking text to fit the cell.

00:23
Here we are using GNU/Linux  as our operating system and LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

00:33
First, let us learn about formatting borders in LibreOffice Calc.

00:38
Let us open our “personal finance tracker.ods” file.

00:43
Formatting of borders can be done on a particular cell or a block of cells.

00:49
For example, let us format the cells with the headings “Serial Number”, “Item”, “Cost”, “Spent”, ”Received”, ”Date” and ”Account”.

01:00
So, let us first click on the cell with the heading Serial Number, denoted by “SN”.

01:07
Now, hold down the left mouse button and drag it along the cells containing the headings.

01:13
After selecting the entire horizontal row containing the headings, click on the “Borders” icon on the Formatting toolbar.

01:22
A drop down box opens up containing several border styles.

01:27
Click on one of the styles you want to apply on the borders.

01:32
I will click on the last option.

01:35
We see that the borders get formatted according to  our selected style.

01:41
Let us undo this change.

01:44
The selected cells are still highlighted. Right-click on the selection and choose “Format Cells” option.

01:53
Now click on the “Borders” tab.

01:56
You will see the options for “Line arrangement”, “Line”, “Spacing to contents” and “Shadow style”.

02:04
Displayed in each of these are the default settings of Calc.

02:08
But one can change any of these to suit our requirement.

02:14
Under “User-defined”, you can see a small preview window which displays the selection.

02:21
I will choose the third option under “Default” and you can see that it is reflected in the preview window.

02:29
I will also change the “Style”, “Width” and “Color”.

02:33
Again, notice the change in the preview window.

02:37
Spacing to contents has the “Synchronize” option checked.

02:41
This means that the same spacing is applied to all the margins.

02:46
One can uncheck it and change the margin spacing as per the requirement.

02:52
I will change “Top” and “Bottom” margins to 1.4pt.

02:59
I will leave you to explore the various Shadow styles, on your own.

03:03
Click on OK.

03:05
This will apply the chosen style to the selected cells.

03:10
After learning how to format borders, now let us learn how to give background colors to cells.

03:17
In order to give background colors to cells, Calc provides an option called “Background Color”, located in the Formatting toolbar.

03:27
Now, let us see how it is implemented.

03:30
For example, let us give a background color to the cells containing the headings.

03:36
So, let us first click on the cell which contains the heading Serial Number, denoted by “SN”.

03:43
Now hold down the left mouse button and drag it along the cells containing the headings.

03:49
After selecting the entire horizontal row containing the headings, click on the “Background Color” option in the Formatting toolbar.

04:00
A pop-up menu opens up where you can select the color you want to apply as a background color.

04:08
Let us click on “Grey” color.

04:11
You can see that the cell background for the headings turns grey.

04:16
Calc provides various options for formatting multiple lines of text.

04:21
The first one is by using “Automatic Wrapping”.

04:25
"Automatic Wrapping” allows a user to enter multiple lines of text into a single cell.

04:32
So, let us see how it is implemented.

04:35
Now, in our “personal finance tracker.ods” sheet, let us click on a empty cell.

04:43
For example, let's click on cell number “B12”.

04:47
Now, do a right-click on cell and then click on the “Format Cells” option.

04:53
Now, click on the “Alignment” tab in the dialog box.

04:57
At the bottom of the dialog box, click on the “Wrap text automatically” option and then click on the OK button.

05:06
Now, we type “THIS IS A PERSONAL FINANCE TRACKER. IT IS VERY USEFUL”.

05:13
You see that the multiple statements get wrapped in a single cell.

05:19
Let's undo the changes.

05:22
After learning about “Automatic Wrapping”, we will now learn how to merge cells in Calc.

05:28
In our “personal finance tracker.ods” file, if we want to merge cells containing the Serial Number with the heading “SN” and their corresponding items then first click on the data entry '1' under the heading “SN”.

05:46
Now, hold down the Shift key on the keyboard and click on the cell with its corresponding item “Salary”.

05:55
This highlights the two cells that are to be merged.

05:59
Next, click on the Format option in the menu bar and then click on the Merge Cells option.

06:06
In the sidebar which pops up, click on the “Merge Cells” option.

06:11
In order to move the contents of both the cells in a single cell, click on the Yes option in the dialog box which appears.

06:21
You see that the selected cells get merged into one and the contents are also within the same merged cell.

06:29
Now let us undo the merging we did by pressing CTRL+Z together.

06:37
Next, we will learn how to shrink text to fit into the cell.

06:42
The font size of the data in a cell can be automatically adjusted to fit into a cell.

06:49
Let us learn how to do it.

06:51
Let's type the text “This is for the month of January” in the cell referenced as B14.

06:59
You see that the text doesn't fit into the cell.

07:03
In order to shrink the text so that it fits, click on the cell referenced as B14 first.

07:10
Now click on the Format option in the menu bar and then click on “Cells”.

07:18
Alternately, right-click on the cell and click on “Format Cells”.

07:23
You see that the “Format Cells” dialog-box opens.

07:27
Click on the “Alignment” tab in the dialog-box.

07:32
At the bottom of the dialog box, click on the “Shrink to fit cell size” check-box and then click on the OK button.

07:41
You see that the entire text shrinks and adjusts itself by decreasing its font size so that the text fits into the cell referenced as B14.

07:53
Let's undo the changes.

07:56
This brings us to the end of the Spoken Tutorial on LibreOffice Calc.
