Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Linking in Calc in LibreOffice Calc.

00:06
In this tutorial, we will learn the following:

00:10
* How to reference other sheets in Calc.

00:14
* How to use hyperlinks in Calc.

00:18
Here, we are using GNU/Linux as our operating system and LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

00:28
LibreOffice Calc allows you to reference:

00:31
* A cell from another sheet to a cell in the current sheet.

00:36
* A cell from another spreadsheet, if you have saved both the spreadsheets.

00:42
Let’s open “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods”.

00:47
The sheet 1 of our file contains the spreadsheet for “Personal Finance Tracker”.

00:53
I have added some amounts in the columns “Spent” and “Received”.

01:03
Now, let us find the sum total of the components under “Cost” and
“Spent” respectively. 

01:10
Click on the cell referenced as C9 and enter the formula is equal to SUM and within braces C3 colon C7.

01:22
Then press the Enter key.

01:26
Click on the cell referenced as D9 and using the same formula find the total.

01:34
Now, we will display the total balance under “Cost” and “Spent” on a different sheet using cell referencing.

01:44
Let’s click on the “Sheet 2” tab.

01:47
This opens the new sheet.

01:50
Now, click on the cell referenced as A1 and type the heading “COMPONENT” inside it.

01:58
Click on the cell referenced as B1 and type the heading “BALANCE” inside it.

02:06
Now, let’s enter the names of the components under the heading.

02:10
Click on the cell referenced as A3 and type “COST”. Press Enter.

02:18
Below “COST”, let’s enter the next component as “SPENT” in the cell referenced A4.

02:26
Now, click on the empty cell B3.

02:29
The cells B3 and B4 will have the total balance under the heading “COST” and “SPENT”

02:36
which we calculated in “Sheet 1”.

02:40
This will be done by referencing.

02:43
To make the cell reference in cell B3, click on the “equal to” sign next to the Input line.

02:52
Now, on the Sheet tab, click on “Sheet 1”.

02:58
In this sheet, we will click on the cell C9 which contains the total under the column “Cost”.

03:06
Notice that in the Input line, the statement “Sheet 1 dot C9” is displayed.

03:13
Now click on the check-mark next to the Input line.

03:18
Notice that the 'grand total' of the data under “Cost” in the “Sheet 1” tab is automatically entered into the cell referenced as B3 in the “Sheet 2 “ tab.

03:33
Similarly, we can enter the grand totals of other components through referencing.

03:39
Referencing can be very useful to summarize data if there are many sheets with a lot of data content.

03:48
Now, let’s learn how to create Hyperlinks in Calc sheets.

03:53
You can use Hyperlinks to jump:
 To a different location within a spreadsheet 
 To different files or 
 Even to web sites. 


04:05
In the “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods”, the personal finance tracker is in “Sheet 1” and the rest of the content is in “Sheet 2”.

04:15
Let’s say we want to jump from Sheet 1 to Sheet 2.

04:20
First, click on the “Sheet 1” tab.

04:24
Here, let’s click on the cell referenced as B14 and enter ”Sheet 2”.

04:31
You see that the name “Sheet 2” is displayed on the Input line.

04:37
Now, select the text “Sheet 2” in the Input Line.

04:42
After selecting the text, click on the “Hyperlink” icon in the toolbar.

04:50
The Hyperlink dialog-box appears.

04:53
On the left side, let’s select the Document option.

04:57
Click on the “Target in document” icon in the dialog-box.

05:02
A new Target in document dialog box appears.

05:06
Now, click on the plus sign next to the Sheet option.

05:12
In the dialog-box which appears, click on the “Sheet 2” option.

05:17
Now, click on the Apply button and then click on the Close button.

05:23
Now, from the Hyperlink dialog-box, click on Apply and then click on Close.

05:30
The “Sheet 1” tab appears in front with the text “Sheet 2” highlighted in the cell.

05:38
Now, when we click on the text “Sheet 2”, it directly takes us to the sheet where we had entered the balance for Cost.

05:49
We have created a hyperlink!

05:53
To remove the hyperlink, first select the hyperlinked text “Sheet 2”.

05:59
Now, right-click and from the context menu, click on the Default Formatting option.

06:07
The text is no longer hyperlinked.

06:11
It is just like any normal text in the document.

06:15
Let us undo the changes.

06:18
This brings us to the end of the Spoken Tutorial on LibreOffice Calc.

06:23
To summarize, we learned how to:
 Reference to other sheets in Calc. 


06:29
