 Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Calc – Working with Cells.

 00:06
 In this tutorial, we will learn:

 00:08
* How to enter numbers, text, numbers as text, date and time in a spreadsheet.

 00:16
* How to use the Format Cells dialog box.

 00:19
* How to navigate between cells and in between sheets.

 00:23
* How to select items in rows, columns and sheets.

 00:29
 We will be using GNU/Linux as our operating system and LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

 00:39
 So, let us first learn how to enter data in the cells.

 00:43
We shall open our “personal finance tracker.ods” file.

 00:49
 You can type any text in a particular cell by simply clicking on the cell and then typing the text, using the keyboard.

 00:59
The text is left-aligned, by default.  One can change the alignment by clicking any one of the alignment tabs on the Formatting Bar.

 01:10
Let's undo this.

 01:12
 Now click on the cell corresponding to “A1” in the spreadsheet.

 01:16
You see that the selected cell gets highlighted.

 01:20
 Here, we have already typed the column headings.

 01:24
 Under the heading “Items”, we shall type the names of a few items one below the other as-  “Salary”, “House rent”, “Electricity bill”, “Phone bill”, “Laundry” and “Miscellaneous”.

 01:38
 In order to enter numbers in the cell, click on the cell and type in the numbers.

 01:43
To enter a negative number, either type a minus sign in front of it or enclose it in parentheses.

 01:53
By default, numbers are right-aligned and negative numbers have a leading minus symbol.

 02:01
Let us undo the changes.

 02:04
 Now, under the Serial Number heading, denoted as “SN” in our “personal finance tracker.ods” spreadsheet, we want the serial number of each item one below the other.

 02:18
So, click on the cell corresponding to “A2” and enter numbers as 1, 2, 3 one below the other.

 02:28
 In order to auto-fill the serial numbers, click on the cell “A4”.  A little black box is visible at the bottom-right corner of the cell.  Drag it till cell “A7” and release the mouse button.

 02:44
You will see that the cells “A5” till “A7” get populated with the subsequent serial numbers.

 02:51
 After entering the serial number of the items, we will now enter the cost of each item under the heading “Cost”.

 02:59
So, we click on the cell referenced as “C3” and type the expense for “House rent” as “Rupees 6000”.

 03:08
 Now, what if we want to precede the number with the Rupee symbol?

 03:12
Let's say, we want to enter “Rupees 800” for “Electricity bill”.  So, right-click on the cell 'C4' and click on “Format Cells” option.

 03:24
 This will open the “Format Cells” dialog-box.

 03:28
The first tab is “Numbers”. Click on it, if not already selected.

 03:32
Various categories can be seen under “Category” such as Number, Percent, Currency, Date, Time and many more.

 03:42
 Let's select Currency.

 03:45
Now, under the Format option, click on the down-arrow. This will display the various currency symbols from across the world.

 03:54
Let's scroll up and select INR Rupees English India.  By default, Rupees 1234 is selected in the drop-down below.

 04:05
You can see a preview of it in the small preview area on the right.

 04:11
 Under Options, we have the option to add the number of Decimal places and the number of Leading zeroes that we want.

 04:20
Notice that as we increase the number of zeroes, the selection under Format has changed to Rupees 1,234 decimal zero zero, indicating 2 decimal places.

 04:35
 Notice the change is displayed in the preview area.

 04:40
 Click on Thousands separator to add the “comma” separator for each thousand. Once again, notice the change in the preview area.

 04:50
 One can also change the font style by clicking on the Font tab.  It has various options for Font, Typeface and Size.

 05:00
 Explore Font Effects and the other tabs to learn more about them.

 05:06
We will learn about the options in the 'Alignment' tab in another tutorial later.

 05:11
Let's click on OK.

05:16
 Let's type 800 and press Enter.  You will notice that the number 800 is represented as Rupees 800 with 2 decimal places.

 05:27
 Now, let's select cells C5 to C7.  Hold the Ctrl key and select cell G2 also.  Notice all the selected cells are highlighted.

 05:40
Right-click on any of the highlighted cells and select Format Cells.

 05:46
Choose the same options as before. Click on OK.

 05:51
 Now, we type the expenses on all the other items one below the other as- “Rupees 600” for “Phone bill”, ”Rupees 300” as “Laundry” charges and “Rupees 2000” as other “Miscellaneous” charges.

 06:06
 Under the heading “Accounts”, we type the salary for the month as “Rupees 30000”.

 06:13
 For entering date in Calc, select the cell and type the date.

 06:18
You can separate the date elements with a forward slash or a hyphen or use text such as 10 October 2011.

 06:28
Calc recognizes a variety of date formats.

 06:32
 Alternately, one can right-click on the cell and choose “Format Cells” option.

 06:38
Choose “Date” under category and the desired format under “Format”.  I will choose 12, 31, 1999.  Notice the display in the preview area.

 06:52
Also, the Format code is displayed below as MM, DD and YYYY.  One can change the Format code as required.

 07:02
I will type DD, MM and YYYY.  Notice the change in the preview area. Click on OK.

07:12
 For entering time in Calc, select the cell and type the time.

 07:18
You can separate time elements with colon such as 10 colon 43 colon 20.

 07:24
 Alternately, one can right-click on the cell and choose “Format Cells” option.

 07:31
Choose “Time” under category and the desired format under “Format”.  I will choose 13, 37, 46.  Notice the display in the preview area.

 07:44
Also, the Format-code is displayed below as HH:MM:SS. One can change the Format-code as required. I will type HH:MM.

 07:57
Notice the change in the preview area. Click on OK.

 08:03
Let us undo the changes.

 08:06
 After learning how to write text, numbers and dates in Calc, we will now learn how to navigate within a spreadsheet from cell to cell and from sheet to sheet.

 08:17
So, we will first see how we can navigate from cell to cell within a spreadsheet.

 08:23
 You can simply access a particular cell by clicking on it with the cursor.

 08:29
You see that the particular cell gets highlighted.

 08:33
 Another method of accessing a particular cell is by using a cell reference.

 08:38
Click on the little black down arrow just to the right of the “Name Box”.

 08:44
Now type the cell-reference of the cell you want to go to and press “Enter” .

 08:49
You can even click into the “Name box”, delete the existing cell reference and type in the cell reference you want and press “Enter”.

 08:58
 Next we will learn how to navigate between cells in a spreadsheet.

 09:03
The first method of navigation between cells is by using the cursor.

09:09
 To move the focus using the cursor, simply move the cursor to the cell where you want the focus to be and click the left mouse button.

 09:19
This changes the focus to the new cell.

 09:22
This method is most useful when the two cells are a large distance apart.

 09:28
 Another method of navigation between cells are - * "Tab" to go to the next cell in a row,

 09:35
* ”Shift + Tab” to go to the previous cell in a row,

 09:39
* “Enter”  to go to the next cell in a column,

 09:42
* “Shift + Enter” to go to the previous cell in a  column.

 09:46
 Next, we will learn how to navigate between different spreadsheets in Calc using the keyboard.

 09:53
 For accessing the sheet to the right of the active sheet, press the “Control” plus “Page Down” keys simultaneously.

 10:01
In order to access the sheet to the left of the current sheet,  press the Control plus Page  Up  keys simultaneously.

 10:08
 You can also navigate between sheets using the cursor.

 10:13
Detailed information on this is available in the tutorial “Working with Sheets”.

 10:19
 If you have a number of sheets then some of the sheet tabs may be hidden behind the horizontal scroll-bar at the bottom of the screen.

 10:28
If this is the case then the four buttons at the bottom-left of the sheet tabs can move the tabs into view.

 10:36
Let us undo the changes.

10:39
 For selecting a range of contiguous cells with the cursor, first click in a cell.

 10:45
Now press and hold down the left mouse button.

 10:49
Move the cursor around the screen and once the desired block of cells is highlighted, release the left mouse button. You see that the selected cells are highlighted.

 11:01
 In order to select multiple columns or rows that are contiguous, click on the first column or row in the group.

 11:09
Now hold down the Shift key.

 11:12
Click the last column or row in the group.

 11:15
To select multiple columns or rows that are not contiguous, click on the first column or row in the group.

 11:23
Hold down the Control key and click on all of the subsequent columns or rows while holding down the “Control” key.

 11:33
 For selecting multiple contiguous sheets, click on the sheet tab for the first desired sheet.

 11:39
Now move the cursor over the sheet tab for the last desired sheet.

 11:44
Hold down the Shift key and click on the sheet tab.

 11:48
All the tabs between these two sheets will turn white which indicates that they are all selected.

 11:56
Any actions that you perform will now affect all highlighted sheets.

 12:02
 For selecting multiple non-contiguous sheets, click on the sheet tab for the first sheet.

 12:08
Now, move the cursor over the third sheet tab.

 12:12
Hold down the Control key and click on the sheet tab.

 12:16
The selected tabs will turn white and any actions that you perform will now affect all highlighted sheets.

 12:25
 This brings us to the end of the Spoken Tutorial on LibreOffice Calc.
