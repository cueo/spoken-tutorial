Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Calc- Inserting Charts in spreadsheets.

00:08
In this tutorial, we will learn the following:

00:11
* Creating, Editing and Formatting Charts

00:15
* Resizing and moving of Charts.

00:18
Here, we are using GNU/Linux as our operating system and LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

00:27
So, let us start learning about the various viewing options in LibreOffice Calc.

00:33
Charts can be powerful ways to convey information to the reader.

00:38
LibreOffice Calc offers a variety of charts formats for your data.

00:43
Using Calc, you can customize charts to a considerable extent too.

00:48
Let us open our "personal finance tracker.ods" sheet.

00:53
And let us fill the amount spent on each of the items listed in the sheet.

00:59
We will click on the cell referenced as E3 and type the amount as 6500.

01:06
Now going down the column, we will type the amounts as 1000, 625, 310 and 2700 in the cell referenced as “E4”, ”E5”, ”E6” and “E7” respectively.

01:26
Next, we shall fill the amounts received on each of the items listed in the sheet.

01:31
So, click on the cell referenced as “F3” and type the amount as 500.

01:37
Now going down this column, we will type the amounts as 200, 75, 10 and 700 in the cells referenced as “F4”, ”F5”, ”F6” and “F7” respectively.

01:54
Let us now learn how to create a chart for this table.

01:58
In order to create a chart, we have to first select the data to be included in the chart.

02:05
So, click on the cell “SN” and without releasing the mouse button, drag the cursor till the last cell which has 700 in it.

02:14
Now, click on the Insert option in the Menu bar and then click on the Chart option.

02:21
You see that the default chart with the date is inserted into the worksheet.

02:27
Simultaneously the "Chart Wizard" dialogue box opens up.

02:32
The "Chart Wizard" shows that the default chart is selected.

02:36
This default chart updates to reflect the changes you make in the Chart Wizard.

02:42
The "Chart Wizard" dialogue-box has three main parts- the steps involved in setting up the chart, choice of chart types and the options for each chart type.

02:55
By checking the 3D Look option, one can also get the chart display in three dimension.

03:03
Let's try these options.

03:06
We will click on the Bar option under the “Choose a chart type” field.

03:11
Observe that the sample chart shows the representation of the data in the table in the “Bar” format.

03:19
Similarly, you can click on the other options like “Pie”, <pause> “Area”, <pause> “Bubble” <pause>

03:28
and many other options under the Choose a chart type field and get the required type of chart.

03:35
Under the Steps option, we have another option named “Data Range”.

03:41
Using this option, you can manually edit the range of data you want to represent in the chart.

03:48
The default option of plotting data is “Data series in columns”.

03:54
We can change the way we want to plot the data by using “Data series in rows” instead.

04:02
This is useful if you use a style of chart such as “Column” to display your data.

04:10
Lastly, you can choose whether to use the “First row as label”

04:17
or “First column as label”

04:22
or both as labels on the axes of the chart.

04:27
Then click on Data series in column again.

04:31
Now, in our sample chart, if we wish to remove the data under the heading “Received”, we can do so by first clicking inside the “Data range” field.

04:42
And then editing the range “$A$1 is to $F$7” to “$A$1 is to $D$7”.

04:56
Observe that the data under the heading “Received” is no longer represented in the chart.

05:03
Next, let's see what “Data Series” does.

05:08
Notice there are 5 rows here, representing the total rows of data in our spreadsheet.

05:14
The “Add” and “Remove” buttons will allow us to add or remove rows of data from the chart.

05:21
We can also re-order the data by using the “Up” and “Down” buttons.

05:27
So, after selecting what and how to represent data in the chart, click on the “Finish” button in the dialog-box.

05:35
You see that the chart is inserted into the spreadsheet.

05:40
After learning about how to insert charts in spreadsheet,

05:44
we will now learn how to format charts in LibreOffice Calc.

05:49
The “Format” menu has many options for formatting

05:53
and fine-tuning the appearance of the charts.

05:57
Let us format the chart we inserted into the spreadsheet.

06:00
So, double-click on the chart so that it is enclosed by a gray border

06:06
indicating that it is in the Edit mode.

06:11
Now, click on the Format option in the main menu.

06:15
You see that the drop down menu contains a number of formatting options like “Format Selection”, “Position and Size”, “Arrangement”, “Chart Wall”, “Chart Area” and many more.

06:30
They are used for positioning the chart, arranging and formatting the background and title of the chart.

06:36
We will learn about the most frequently used formatting options one by one.

06:42
The “Format Selection” option opens a dialog-box with the heading “Chart Area”.

06:49
Observe that there are 3 tabs here - “Borders”, “Area” and “Transparency”.

06:55
By default, Borders tab is selected.

07:00
Let us change the style and color of the chart’s border.

07:04
To do so, click on the “Style” field and choose “Continuous”.

07:09
Then, similarly in the “Color” field click on “Green”.

07:13
Now, click on the OK button.

07:18
Notice that the style and color of the chart border changes accordingly.

07:23
The “Title” option formats the title of the chart and its axes.

07:29
The “Axis” option formats the lines that create the chart

07:33
as well as the font of the text that appears on both the X and Y axes.

07:39
Explore all of these options on your own later, in order to learn what they do.

07:46
Calc also provides an option for changing the background of the chart area.

07:50
The chart area is the area surrounding the chart graphic, including the main title and key.

07:58
To format the chart area, click on the “Format” option and select “Chart Wall”.

08:05
You see that a dialog-box appears with the heading “Chart Wall”.

08:09
The “Style” field displays “Continuous” as this was our last choice.

08:15
In the “Color” field, let’s click on “Red”.

08:19
We will also change the size to “0.20”cm.

08:23
Now click on the OK button.

08:27
You see that the style and color of the chart area changes. <pause>

08:34
Next we will learn about how to resize and move elements in a chart.

08:39
For resizing a chart, click on the sample chart.

08:44
You see that green handles appear around the chart.

08:47
To increase or decrease the size of the chart, click and drag one of the markers in one of the four corners of the chart.

08:55
In order to move the chart, first click on the chart.

09:00
Now hover the cursor anywhere over the chart.

09:04
The cursor turns to a hand.

09:06
Click and move the chart to the desired location. Now, release the mouse button.

09:13
You have moved the chart!

09:17
Next we will learn how to resize charts by using the “Position and Size” dialog box.

09:23
Again, click on the chart.

09:26
Now, right-click on the chart and select “Position and Size” from the context menu.

09:32
The “Position and Size” dialog box appears.

09:36
It has various fields that can set the 'X' and 'Y' positions of the chart as well as the width and height of the chart.

09:45
Let us set the 'X' coordinate to “1.00” “ and 'Y' coordinate to “0.83” “ for our chart.

09:55
Click on the OK button.

09:57
We see that the chart positions itself according to the set values within the chart area.

10:04
This brings us to the end of this Spoken Tutorial.

10:08
To summarize, we learned how to: Create charts, edit and format them.

10:14
