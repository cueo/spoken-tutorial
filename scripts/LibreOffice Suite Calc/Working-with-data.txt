 Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Calc – Working with data.

 00:06
 In this tutorial, we will learn about:

 00:09
Speed up using Fill tools and Selection lists.

 00:13
Sharing content between sheets.

 00:16
Removing data, replacing data and  changing part of a data.

 00:23
 Here we are using:Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 andLibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

00:32
 Entering data into a spreadsheet can be very labor-intensive but Calc provides several tools for making it considerably easier.

 00:42
The most basic ability is to drag and drop the contents of one cell to another with a mouse.

 00:49
But Calc also includes several other tools for automating input, especially of repetitive material.

 00:57
These tools are namely- Fill tool, Selection lists.

 01:01
These can input information into multiple sheets of the same document.

 01:06
 We will learn about each one of them one by one.

 01:09
Let us open our “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” file.

 01:14
 The Fill tool is a useful method for duplicating the contents in the sheet.

 01:19
In our “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” file, let's say- we want to copy the data under the heading Cost to the adjacent cells.

 01:30
Then, first select all the data which needs to be copied by clicking on the cell which contains the entry “6000”.

 01:38
Now, holding down the left mouse button, drag the mouse till the end of the cell which contains the  cost entry “2000”.

 01:46
Also, select the cells where we want to copy the data.

 01:51
Now, release the left mouse button.

 01:53
 Click on the Edit option in the menu bar and then click on the Fill option.

 01:59
In the pop-up menu, click on the Right option.

 02:03
 You see that the data under the heading “Cost” gets copied to the adjacent cells.

 02:09
Let us undo the changes.

 02:12
 A more complex use of the Fill tool is to use it for  filling some series as data in sheets.

 02:20
Calc provides default lists for the full and abbreviated days of the week and the months of the year.

 02:27
It also enables the user to create his own lists.

 02:34
 Now, let's insert a new heading named “Days” in our sheet.

 02:38
Under this, we will display the seven days of the week automatically.

 02:43
 Select the first seven cells below the heading “Days”.

 02:48
 Now, click on the Edit option in the menu bar  and go to the Fill option.

 02:53
Click on the Series option in the menu.

 02:57
 You see that a dialog-box appears with the heading as “Fill Series”.

 03:02
 Now, under the heading- “Series type”, click on the “AutoFill” option.

 03:07
 In the “Start value” field, we type our first day of the week, that is  “Sunday”.

 03:13
The increment is already set as “1”.Now, click on the OK button.

 03:18
 You see that the days are automatically entered into the cells.

 03:23
You can enter only weekdays, month or year by the same method as they are pre-defined in Calc.

 03:32
 Another method for auto-filling of sequential data is as follows-

 03:37
Type “Sunday” in a cell and press Enter.  This will shift the focus to the next cell in the column.

 03:46
Go back to the cell where “Sunday” was typed.  You will now see a small black box at the bottom-right-hand corner of the cell.

 03:55
Click on this box with the mouse.

 03:57
Drag it downwards till you see Saturday in the display box on the right.

 04:04
Release the mouse button.

 04:06
The cells get filled with the weekdays automatically.

 04:10
This trick works for all data that are sequential. Let us undo the changes.

04:17
 You can also create a one-time fill series for numbers by entering the start, end and the increment values.

 04:24
To demonstrate this, we will first delete the serial numbers already entered in the cells “A1” to “ A7”.

 04:33
 After deleting the numbers, select the cells referenced as “A2” to “A7” again.

 04:40
 Now, click on the Edit in the menu bar and then on Fill and Series option.

 04:46
 A dialog-box appears in front of us.Now, click on the Linear option, under the heading “Series type”, if it is not selected by default.

 04:57
 In the “Start value” field, we will type the first serial number- that is “1”.

 05:03
 In the “End value” field, we will type the last value to be entered as “6”.

 05:08
 Now, we set the “Increment” value as “1” and finally click on the OK button.

 05:14
We see that the cells automatically get filled with the sequential serial numbers.

 05:21
 In all these cases, the Fill tool creates only a momentary connection between the cells. Once they are filled, the cells have no further connection with one another.

05:32
 Apart from Fill tools, there is one more speed up tool called “Selection lists” which is limited to using only text.

 05:40
We will discuss it in the later tutorials of this series.

 05:45
 After learning about the “Fill tools” and “Selection lists”, we will now learn how to share content between sheets.

 05:52
Calc enables a user to enter the same information in the same cell on multiple sheets.

 05:58
This means, instead of entering the same list on each sheet individually, you can enter it in all the sheets at once.

 06:07
 In our “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” file, our entire data is on Sheet 1.

 06:14
Now, we want “Sheet 2” as well as “Sheet 3” to show the same data as in Sheet 1.

 06:21
 So, we click on the Edit option in the menu bar and then click on the “Sheet” option.

 06:27
 Now, click on Select.

 06:30
 Now, in the dialog-box which appears, using shift key we select the options Sheet 1, “Sheet 2” and Sheet 3.

 06:40
And then click on the OK button.

 06:42
 This takes us back to Sheet 1.

 06:45
Now, let's enter some data in “Sheet 1”.

 06:49
For example- in the cell referenced as “F12”, we’ll type “This will be displayed on multiple sheets”.

 06:57
Now, click on the “Sheet 2” and the “Sheet 3” tab one after the other.

 07:02
We see that in each of these sheets, the cell referenced as “F12” contains the same data.

 07:09
Let us undo the changes.

 07:12
 Next, we will learn about different ways in which we can delete and edit data in the cells.

 07:18
To delete data without removing any of the formatting of the cell, just select a cell.

 07:25
You see that the data of the cell is displayed in the “Input line” field.

 07:30
Now, press the Backspace button on the keyboard.

 07:35
You see that the data gets deleted.

 07:37
Let us undo the changes.

 07:39
 To replace the data in a cell, simply select the cell and type over the old data.

 07:46
The new data will retain the original formatting.Let us undo the changes.

 07:52
 In order to change a part of the data in a cell, without removing all of the contents, just double-click on the cell.

 08:01
Now, by navigating the cursor, you can edit the cell as per your requirement.

 08:07
Let us undo the changes.

 08:09
