Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Formulas and Functions in LibreOffice Calc.

00:07
In this tutorial, we will learn about: Conditional Operator If..Or statement Basic statistic   functions Rounding off numbers.

00:19
Here, we are using Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 as our operating system and LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

00:30
We have already learnt to apply the basic arithmetic operators like addition, subtraction and average on data.

00:39
Now, let’s learn about a few other useful operators.

00:43
One of the most commonly used operator is the Conditional Operator.

00:51
Conditional Operators: check for the condition applied on the data by the user

00:56
and then show results in Boolean - TRUE or FALSE.

01:01
Let’s open “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods”.

01:05
Here, under the heading “Cost”, we have listed the prices of several items.

01:11
Let’s apply conditional operators on them and analyze the results.

01:17
Let’s click on the cell referenced as “B10” and type “Condition Result” inside it.

01:24
Now, click on the cell referenced as “C10”.

01:28
The condition’s result will be applied and displayed in this cell.

01:33
Note that the cost of the “House Rent” is rupees 6,000.

01:38
The cost for the “Electricity Bill” is rupees 800.

01:43
The cost of “House Rent” is more than that of “Electricity Bill”.

01:48
We can apply different conditions on them and check the results.

01:54
Click on the cell referenced as “C10”.

01:57
In this cell, type the first condition as: is equal to C3 greater than C4  and press the Enter key.

02:09
Since the value in cell C3 is greater than the value in cell 'C4', the result we get is “TRUE”.

02:18
Now, let us change this conditional statement to: is equal to C3 less than C4.

02:26
Press Enter.

02:28
The result we get is FALSE.

02:32
In the same manner, you can apply other conditional statements and study the results.

02:38
These statements are very useful when dealing with large amounts of data.

02:44
You can also use the If and Or condition on data

02:49
 to print the results according to the condition that holds TRUE.

02:55
Let’s click on the cell referenced as “C10” and type:

02:59
is equal to IF and within braces, C3 greater than C4 comma, within double quotes “Positive” comma and again within double quotes “Negative”.

03:16
This means, if the value in cell C3 is greater than the value in cell C4, “Positive” will be displayed

03:25
or else “Negative” will be displayed.

03:28
Now, press Enter.

03:31
Notice that the result is “Positive” since rupees 6000 is greater than rupees 800.

03:39
Now, in the conditional statement, let’s change “greater than” to “less than” and press the Enter key.

03:47
Note that the result is now “Negative”, as the value in cell C3 is greater than the value in cell C4.

03:57
You can also see the change in result, if we change the data in the cells C3 and C4.

04:04
The result which is displayed now is Negative.

04:09
Now, let us increase the value in cell C4 to “7000” and press the Enter key.

04:17
The result automatically changes to “Positive”.

04:22
Again, let’s decrease the value in cell C4 to “800”

04:26
and press the Enter key.

04:29
The result again automatically changes to “Negative”.

04:34
Now, let us delete the changes made.

04:38
Next, let’s learn a few arithmetic and statistic functions.

04:43
Basic arithmetic functions include:SUM for addition,PRODUCT for multiplication,QUOTIENT for division and many more which we have already learnt in the earlier tutorials.

04:57
Now, let’s perform some operations to check how the Sum, Product and the Quotient functions work.

05:05
First, let’s select “Sheet 3”.

05:08
Enter the numbers “50”, ”100” and ”150” within the cells referenced “B1”, “B2” and “B3” respectively.

05:19
Click on the cell A4 and type SUM.

05:23
Click on the cell B4.

05:26
We shall compute the result in this cell.

05:30
Type: is equal to “SUM” and within the braces B1 comma B2 comma B3.

05:37
Press Enter.

05:39
Notice the result shows “300”.

05:43
You can also enter a range of cells like this.

05:47
Click on B4 again.

05:49
Now, within the braces, instead of B1 comma B2 comma B3, type B1 colon B3

05:58
Press Enter.

06:00
Once again, the result shows “300”.

06:03
Now, let’s click on the cell “A5” and type: “PRODUCT”.

06:08
Click on the cell “B5”.

06:10
Here, type: is equal to “PRODUCT” and within the braces, B1 colon B3.

06:18
Press Enter.

06:20
Notice, the result shows “7,50,000”.

06:26
Now, let’s see how Quotient works.

06:29
Click on the cell referenced “A6” and type: “QUOTIENT”.

06:34
Now click on the cell “B6”.

06:37
We shall use this cell to compute the result.

06:40
And type: is equal to QUOTIENT and within the braces, B2 comma B1.

06:47
Press Enter.

06:49
You will get the result as “2”. That is because “100” divided by “50” gives 2.

06:59
Similarly, we can perform various arithmetic operations in Calc.

07:05
Now, let’s learn how to implement Statistic Functions.

07:09
Statistical functions are useful for analysis of data in spreadsheets.For example-functions like COUNT, MIN, MAX, MEDIAN, MODE and many more are statistical in nature.

07:27
First, let us click on sheet 1.

07:30
Let’s see how to find the minimum, the maximum and the median costs, using statistical functions.

07:37
Let’s click on the cell referenced as “C10” where we will be displaying the result.

07:44
Under the heading “Cost”, we have very few entries.

07:48
The minimum cost is rupees 300.

07:51
The maximum cost is rupees 6000.

07:55
These are the results which should be displayed when we use their functions.

08:00
In the cell “C10”, let’s type: is equal to MAX and within braces C3 colon C7.

08:10
Now, press the Enter key.

08:13
Notice that the result is “6000” which is the maximum value in the column.

08:20
Now, let’s replace the term “MAX” in the statement with “MIN”

08:25
and press the Enter key.

08:28
Note that the result is “300” which is the minimum amount in the Cost column.

08:34
To find the median value, replace the term “MIN” with “MEDIAN”

08:40
and press the Enter key.

08:43
The result shows “800” which is the median cost in the column.

08:50
Similarly, you can use other statistical functions on data and analyze them accordingly.

08:58
Let us delete the changes in this cell.

09:02
Now, let’s learn how to round off numbers.

09:05
Let us make few changes under the heading- “Cost”.

09:09
We shall change:“6000” to “6000.34”“600” to “600.4”, ”300” to “300.3”.

09:23
Now, click on the cell referenced as “B11” and type the heading “ROUNDING OFF”.

09:31
Click on the cell referenced as “C11” where we will find the total of the items under the heading “Cost”.

09:39
In the cell C11, let’s type: is equal to SUM and within braces C3 colon C7.

09:49
Now, press the Enter key.

09:53
Notice that the total is “9701.04”.

09:59
Now, suppose, we don’t want any decimal places in our result.

10:04
The best solution is to round off the result to the nearest whole number.

10:09
Let us click on the cell with the total “9701.04”.

10:15
Type: is equal to ROUND, open brace SUM and again within braces C3 colon C7.

10:25
Close the brace. Press the Enter key.

10:29
You see that the result is now “9701” which is “9701.04”, rounded off to the nearest whole number.

10:44
Rounding off can also be done to either the lower whole number or the higher number.

10:52
Let’s click on the cell with the result and edit the term “ROUND” to “ROUNDUP”.

10:59
Now, press the Enter key.

11:02
You see that the result is now “9702” which is the higher whole number.

11:10
In order to round off to the lower whole number, change the term “ROUNDUP” to “ROUNDDOWN”

11:17
and press the Enter key.

11:19
The result is now “9701” which is the lower whole number.

11:28
Let us undo these changes in order to get our “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” to its original form.

11:37
This brings us to the end of this Spoken Tutorial on LibreOffice Calc.
