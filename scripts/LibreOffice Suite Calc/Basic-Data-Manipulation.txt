 Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Calc – Basics of Data Manipulation.

 00:07
 In this tutorial, we will learn about:

 00:09
* Introduction to basics of Formula

 00:12
* Sorting by Columns

 00:15
* Basics of Filtering Data.

 00:17
 Here, we are using Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 as our operating system and  LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

 00:27
 Let us begin the tutorial by learning about the basic formulas used in LibreOffice Calc.

 00:35
Formulas are equations that use numbers and variables to get a result.

 00:41
In a spreadsheet, the variables are cell locations that hold the data needed for the equation to be completed.

 00:47
 The most basic arithmetic operations which are performed are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

 00:56
 Let us open our “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” file first.

01:02
 In our “personal finance tracker.ods” file, let us see how to add the cost of all the expenses mentioned under the heading, “Cost”.

 01:13
 We shall give one more heading as “SUM TOTAL”, just under “Miscellaneous”.

 01:19
And we shall click on the cell A8 and give the serial number as “7”.

 01:25
 Now, let's click on cell number “C8” where we want to display the total of the costs.

 01:32
 In order to add all the costs, we’ll type: is equal to SUM and within braces the range of columns to be added, that is, C3 colon C7.

 01:44
Now, press Enter on the keyboard.

 01:47
You see that all the items under “Cost” get added.

 01:51
 Now, let's learn how to subtract in Calc.

 01:55
 If we want to subtract the cost of “House Rent” and “ Electricity Bill” and display it in the cell referenced as A9, simply click on the 'A9' cell first.

 02:06
 Now, in this cell, type is equal to and within braces the respective cell references, that is, C3 minus C4.

 02:17
Press the Enter key on the keyboard.

 02:20
 We see that the cost in the two cell references get subtracted and the result is displayed in cell number 'A9'.

 02:29
Let's undo the changes.

 02:32
 Similarly, one can divide and multiply data in different cells.

 02:37
 Another basic operation in a spreadsheet is finding the average of numbers.

 02:43
Let us see how it is implemented.

 02:45
 Let's give the heading as “Average” just below the “SUM TOTAL” cell.

 02:50
Here, we want to display the average of the total cost.

 02:55
 So, let's click on the “C9” cell.

 02:58
Now we type: is equal to  Average and Cost within braces.

 03:04
 Press the Enter key on the keyboard.

 03:07
You see that the average of the “Cost” column gets displayed in the cell.

 03:11
Let's undo the changes.

 03:15
 Similarly, you can find average of elements in a horizontal row.

 03:20
 We will learn more about formulae and operators in advanced level tutorials.

 03:25
Let us now learn how to sort data in a Calc spreadsheet.

 03:30
 Sorting arranges the visible cells on the sheet in any desired manner.

 03:35
In Calc, you can sort the data using up to three criteria which are then applied one after another.

 03:43
They  are handy when you are searching for a particular item and become even more powerful after you have filtered data.

 03:51
 Let's say, we want to sort the data under the heading “Costs”, in the ascending order.

 03:57
So, first, we highlight the cells to be sorted by clicking on the cell “Cost”.

 04:03
 Now holding down the left mouse button, drag it along the column till the end of the cell which says “2000”.

 04:12
 This selects the column which we want to sort.

 04:15
 Now, click on the Data option in the menu bar and then click on Sort.

 04:21
Next, select Current Selection.

 04:24
 You see that a dialog-box appears with tabs as “Sort criteria” and “Options”.

 04:31
 In the “Sort criteria” tab, select Cost in the “Sort by” field.

 04:37
In order to sort the “Cost” in ascending order, click on the Ascending option just next to it.

 04:44
 Now, click on the OK button.

 04:47
 You see that the column gets sorted in the ascending order.

 04:51
 Similarly, to sort in the descending order, click on Descending and then click on the OK button.

 04:59
Let us Undo the changes.

 05:02
 Multiple columns can be sorted by first selecting all the columns and then applying the sort options.

 05:09
 Let's say, we want to sort the serial numbers as well as the cost.

 05:14
So, first select these columns as we did earlier.

 05:18
 Now, click on the Data option in the menu bar and then click on Sort.

 05:24
 In the dialog-box which appears, first select “Cost” in the “Sort by” field.

 05:30
Then select “SN” in the “Then by” field.

 05:35
 Click on Descending in both the options near them and then click on the OK button.

 05:43
 You see that both the headings get sorted in the descending order.

 05:47
Let's Undo the changes.

 05:49
 Now, let's learn how to filter data in LibreOffice Calc.

 05:53
A filter is a list of conditions that each entry has to meet in order to be displayed.

 06:00
 In order to apply a filter in the spreadsheet, let's click on the cell named “Item”.

 06:07
Now, click on the “Data” option in the menu bar and then click on “Filter”.

06:12
 Click on the “AutoFilter” option in the pop-up menu.

 06:16
 You see that an arrow mark appears on the headings.

 06:20
Click on the down-arrow on the cell named “Item”.

 06:24
 Now, suppose if you want to display only the data related to “Electricity Bill”..

 06:29
So, click on the “Electricity Bill” option.

 06:34
 You see that only the data related to “Electricity Bill” is displayed in the sheet.

 06:40
The rest of the options are filtered out.

 06:43
 In order to view all the data, again click on the downward arrow on the cell named Item and click on “All”.

 06:52
 We see that we are now able to view all the data which we had originally written.

 06:59
 Apart from “AutoFilter”, there are two more filter options namely “Standard Filter” and “Advanced Filter” which we will learn about in the later stages of this series.

 07:11
