Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Linking in Calc- in LibreOffice Calc.

00:06
In this tutorial, we will learn the following:

00:10
How to reference other sheets in Calc.

00:13
How to use hyperlinks in Calc.

00:17
Here we are using Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 as our operating system and LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

00:29
LibreOffice Calc allows you to reference-

00:033
A cell from another sheet to a cell in the current sheet

00:37
A cell from another spread sheet, if you have saved both the spreadsheets.

00:44
Let’s open “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods”.

00:49
The sheet 1 of our file contains the spreadsheet for “Personal Finance Tracker”.

00:55
I have added some amounts in the columns “Spent” and “Received”.

01:04
Now, let us find the sum total of the components under “Cost” and “Spent” respectively.

01:11
Click on the cell referenced as C9 and enter the formula: is equal to SUM and within braces C3 colon C7.

01:24
Then press the Enter key.

01:27
Click on the cell referenced as D9 and using the same formula find the total.

01:36
Now, we will display the total balance under “Cost” and “Spent” on a different sheet using cell referencing.

01:45
Let’s click on the “Sheet 2” tab.

01:48
This opens the new sheet.

01:51
Now, click on the cell referenced as A1 and type the heading “COMPONENT” inside it.

02:00
Click on the cell referenced as B1 and type the heading “BALANCE” inside it.

02:07
Now, let’s enter the names of the components under the heading.

02:12
Click on the cell referenced as A3 and type“COST”. Press Enter.

02:19
Below “COST”, let’s enter the next component as “SPENT” in the cell referenced A4.

02:27
Now, click on the empty cell B3.

02:31
The cells B3 and B4 will have the total balance under the heading “COST” and “SPENT”

02:38
which we calculated in “Sheet 1”.

02:41
This will be done by referencing.

02:44
To make the cell reference in cell B3, click on the equal to sign next to the Input line.

02:53
Now, on the Sheet tab click on “Sheet 1”.

02:59
In this sheet, we will click on the cell C9 which contains the total under the column “Cost”.

03:07
Notice that in the “Input line”, the statement “Sheet 1 dot C9” is displayed.

03:15
Now, click on the check mark next to the “Input line”.

03:20
Notice that the grand total of the data under “Cost” in the “Sheet 1” tab is automatically entered into the cell, referenced as B3, in the "Sheet 2 " tab.

03:34
Similarly, we can enter the grand totals of other components through referencing.

03:41
Referencing can be very useful to summarize data if there are many sheets, with a lot of data content.

03:49
Now, let’s learn how to create Hyperlinks in Calc sheets.

03:55
You can use Hyperlinks to jump:To a different location within a spreadsheet To different files or Even to web sites.

04:06
In the “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods”,the personal finance tracker is in “Sheet 1” and the rest of the content is in “Sheet 2”.

04:17
Let’s say we want to jump from Sheet 1 to Sheet 2.

04:22
First, click on the “Sheet 1” tab.

04:25
Here, let’s click on the cell referenced as B14 and enter ”Sheet 2”.

04:33
You see that the name “Sheet 2” is displayed on the Input line.

04:38
Now, select the text “SHEET 2” in the Input Line.

04:44
After selecting the text, click on the Hyperlink icon in the toolbar.

04:51
The Hyperlink dialog-box appears.

04:55
On the left side, let’s select the Document option.

04:59
Click on the Target in document icon in the dialog-box.

05:04
A new “Target in document” dialog-box appears.

05:08
Now, click on the plus sign next to the “Sheet” option.

05:13
In the dialog-box which appears, click on the “Sheet 2” option.

05:18
Now, click on the Apply button and then click on the Close button.

05:24
Now, from the Hyperlink dialog-box, click on Apply and then click on Close.

05:32
The “Sheet 1” tab appears in front with the text “Sheet 2” highlighted in the cell.

05:40
Now, when we click on the text “Sheet 2”, it directly takes us to the sheet where we had entered the balance for "Cost".

05:51
We have created a hyperlink!

05:55
To remove the hyperlink, first select the hyperlinked text “Sheet 2”.

06:01
Now, right-click and from the context menu, click on the “Default Formatting” option.

06:09
The text is no longer hyperlinked.

06:12
It is just like any normal text in the document.

06:16
Let us undo the changes.

06:20
This brings us to the end of the Spoken Tutorial on LibreOffice Calc.

06:25
To summarize, we learned how to: Reference to other sheets in Calc.

06:31
