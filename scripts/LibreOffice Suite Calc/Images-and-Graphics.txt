Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on Inserting images in LibreOffice Calc.

00:06
In this tutorial, we will learn the following:

00:09
Inserting an image file into a document.

00:13
For e.g. - jpeg, png or bmp.

00:19
Here, we are using:Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 and LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

00:28
Images can be added into a spreadsheet by-Inserting an image file directly From a graphics program With the help of a clipboard orFrom the gallery.

00:39
We will discuss each one of them in detail.

00:43
Let us open our “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” spreadsheet.

00:48
First, let us select sheet 2.

00:51
We will insert images in this sheet.

00:54
It is a good practice to select a cell and then insert pictures.

00:59
If an image is already stored on your computer, you can insert it by first clicking on Insert

01:06
and then Picture and selecting From File.

01:10
Now, locate the image you want to insert.

01:14
I have already stored some images on the Desktop, in a folder named “Images”.

01:20
So, I will choose "Image1".

01:24
We will see the name of the image in the “Location” field .

01:28
Click on the Open button.

01:31
Observe that the image appears in the spreadsheet. <pause>

01:38
Let us insert another picture by linking it.

01:42
First, let us select a new cell.

01:45
Now, let’s click on Insert and Picture and select From File. Let us select another image.

01:55
Now, click on “Image 2”.

01:58
To link the image to your document, check the Linkoption and click Open.

02:05
In the dialog-box that appears, click on Keep Link button.

02:11
The picture is now linked to the file.

02:15
Linking:

02:17
When we link a file- First, it reduces the size of the spreadsheet when it is saved

02:23
since our spreadsheet does not contain the image.

02:27
Second, it enables the user to modify both the files separately.

02:32
Any changes made to the image file will be reflected in the linked image in the spreadsheet.

02:39
Let us change the color of "Image 2" which is linked to the file, to greyscale.

02:46
I am using the picture editor GIMP to edit this picture.

02:50
You can use any editor that is installed on your machine.

02:54
First, let’s save and close "Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods".

03:01
Next, go to the images folder.

03:04
Select "Image 2".

03:06
Now, right-click and select Open with GIMP.

03:10
"Image 2" opens in GIMP.

03:13
Now, let us change the picture from color to Grayscale.

03:18
Now, let’s save and close the image.

03:22
Let us open the "Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods".

03:26
"Image 2" is now displayed in grayscale.

03:30
However, one major disadvantage of linking the file is that- whenever you want to send this spreadsheet to a different computer or user,

03:40
you will have to send both- the spreadsheet as well as the image file.

03:44
Which means, you will always have to keep track of the location where you are storing both the files.

03:52
Let’s move this image to the right of the spreadsheet.

03:58
Another method of inserting images into a spreadsheet is by dragging it from its folder

04:05
where you have stored the image and dropping it on your spreadsheet.

04:09
Let us drag and drop an image.

04:12
Now, drag and drop the image file directly into your spreadsheet wherever you want to place it.

04:19
You will see that the image gets inserted into your document.

04:23
Let’s undo this change by pressing CTRL and Z.

04:29
Now, let us link the image using the drag and drop method.

04:34
This is easy too! Just press and hold the Control and Shift keys

04:40
while dragging the image into the spreadsheet.

04:44
The image file is now linked to the document.

04:48
Let’s save this Calc file by pressing Ctrl and S keys together.

04:54
Now, let’s close this file.

04:58
Now, let’s go to the folder where the image is located.

05:02
Let’s rename the image “Image 3.jpg”, that we inserted in the file, to “Image4.jpg”.

05:12
Now, open the “Personal Finance Tracker.ods” file again.

05:18
You see that the linked image is no longer visible!

05:22
The linked path shows an error!

05:25
Let us delete this link.

05:28
Pause this tutorial and do this assignment.

05:32
Insert an image as a link in a Calc sheet, save and close it.

05:38
Now, go to the folder where the image is stored and delete the image.

05:43
Open and check if the image is still visible in the Calc file.

05:49
Now, paste the image back into the image folder.

05:53
Check if the image is visible in the Calc file.

05:57
Notice, a new toolbar just below the “Standard” toolbar.

06:02
This is the “Picture” toolbar.

06:04
The Filter button at the top left of the “Picture” toolbar gives several options to change the look of the image.

06:13
Let’s undo this by typing Ctrl and Z.

06:18
The Graphics mode button has options to change the image into Grayscale, black-and-white or as a watermark.

06:26
There are other options on the Picture toolbar which we will cover later.

06:32
Next, we will learn how to insert image from a clipboard.

06:37
One can copy images stored on the clipboard, from one LibreOffice spreadsheet to another.

06:44
Let's create a new spreadsheet and name it as “abc.ods”.

06:50
This is our target document.

06:53
We already have an image in our “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” file.

06:59
This is our source document.

07:02
Now, select the image from the source file which is to be copied.

07:06
Press Ctrl and C keys together to copy the image.

07:11
The image is now saved on the clipboard.

07:15
Now switch to the target document which is “abc.ods”.

07:21
Select the location where you wish to place your saved image in “abc.ods”.

07:28
Now, press Ctrl and V keys together to insert the image into the document.

07:35
We see that the image is inserted into our target file.

07:42
Now we will learn how to insert images directly from the Calc Gallery.

07:48
Gallery has image as well as sounds which you can insert into your spreadsheet.

07:54
Let’s see how to do this.

07:57
Click on the Gallery icon in the standard toolbar.

08:01
Alternately, click on Tools option in the menu bar and then click on Gallery to open it.

08:09
Now, go through the images which the “Gallery” provides and click on the image you want to insert into your document.

08:18
Drag the image from the “Gallery” and drop it into the spreadsheet where you want to insert it.

08:26
You see that the image gets inserted into our “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” file.

08:34
This brings us to the end of this spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Calc.

08:39
To summarize, we learned how to:Insert an image file into a spreadsheet in many different ways,

08:46
like-from a file from the clipboard or from the gallery.
