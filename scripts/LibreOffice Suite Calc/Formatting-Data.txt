Welcome to the Spoken tutorial on LibreOffice Calc – Formatting Data in Calc.

00:06
In this tutorial, we will learn about: Formatting borders, background colors

00:12
Formatting multiple lines of text using Automatic Wrapping

00:18
Merging Cells  Shrinking text to fit the cell.

00:22
Here, we are using Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 as our operating system and LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4.

00:33
First, let us learn about formatting borders in LibreOffice Calc.

00:39
Let us open our "personal finance tracker.ods" file.

00:45
Formatting of borders can be done on a particular cell or a block of cells.

00:50
For example- let us format the cells with the headings Serial Number, Item, Cost, Spent, Received, Date and Account.

01:01
So, let us first click on the cell with the heading "Serial Number", denoted by "SN".

01:08
Now, hold down the left mouse button and drag it along the cells containing the headings.

01:14
After selecting the entire horizontal row containing the headings, click on the Borders icon on the Formatting toolbar.

01:23
A drop-down box opens up containing several border styles.

01:28
Click on one of the styles, you want to apply on the borders.

01:33
I will click on the last option.

01:34
We see that the borders get formatted according to  our selected style.

01:39
Let us undo this change.

01:45
The selected cells are still highlighted. Right-click on the selection and choose Format Cells option.

01:54
Now, click on the Borders tab.

01:56
You will see the options for Line arrangement, Line, Spacing to contents and Shadow style.

02:05
Displayed in each of these are the default settings of Calc.

02:10
But, one can change any of these to suit our requirement.

02:14
Under User-defined, you can see a small preview window which displays the selection.

02:22
I will choose the third option under Default and you can see that it is reflected in the preview window.

02:29
I will also change the Style, Width and Color.

02:33
Again notice the change in the preview window.

02:38
Spacing to contents has the Synchronize option checked.

02:42
This means that the same spacing is applied to all the margins.

02:47
One can uncheck it and change the margin spacing as per the requirement.

02:53
I will change Top and Bottom margins to 1.4pt.

03:00
I will leave you to explore the various Shadow styles, on your own.

03:04
Click on OK.

03:06
This will apply the chosen style to the selected cells.

03:11
After learning how to format borders, now let us learn how to give background colors to cells.

03:18
In order to give background colors to cells, Calc provides an option called Background Color, located in the Formatting toolbar.

03:27
Now, let us see how it is implemented.

03:30
For example, let us give a background color to the cells containing the headings.

03:36
So, let us first click on the cell which contains the heading "Serial Number", denoted by "SN".

03:44
Now, hold down the left mouse button and drag it along the cells containing the headings.

03:50
After selecting the entire horizontal row containing the headings, click on the “Background Color” option in the Formatting toolbar.

04:00
A pop-up menu opens up where you can select the color you want to apply as a background.

04:08
Let us click on “Grey” color.

04:11
You can see that the cell background for the headings turns grey.

04:17
Calc provides various options for formatting multiple lines of text.

04:22
The first one is by using “Automatic Wrapping”.

04:26
"Automatic Wrapping” allows a user to enter multiple lines of text into a single cell.

04:33
So, let us see how it is implemented.

04:37
Now, in our “personal finance tracker.ods” sheet, let us click on an empty cell.

04:44
For example- let's click on cell number “B12”.

04:49
Now, do a right-click on cell and then click on the “Format Cells” option.

04:54
Now, click on the “Alignment” tab, in the dialog-box.

04:58
At the bottom of the dialog-box, click on the “Wrap text automatically” option and then click on the OK button.

05:08
Now, we type “THIS IS A PERSONAL FINANCE TRACKER. IT IS VERY USEFUL”.

05:11
You see that the multiple statements get wrapped in a single cell.

05:19
Let's undo the changes.

05:21
After learning about “Automatic Wrapping”, we will now learn how to merge cells in Calc.

05:29
In our “personal finance tracker.ods” file , if we want to merge cells containing the Serial Number with the heading “SN” and their corresponding items, then first click on the data entry '1' under the heading “SN”.

05:46
Now, hold down the Shift key on the keyboard and click on the cell with its corresponding item, “Salary”.

05:55
This highlights the two cells that are to be merged.

05:59
Next, click on the “Format” option in the menu bar and then click on the “Merge Cells” option.

06:07
In the sidebar which pops-up, click on the “Merge Cells” option.

06:12
In order to move the contents of both the cells in a single cell, click on the Yes option in the dialog-box which appears.

06:21
You see that the selected cells get merged into one and the contents are also within the same merged cell.

06:31
Now, let us undo the merging we did by clicking on Ctrl+Z together.

06:37
Next, we will learn how to shrink text to fit into the cell.

06:41
The font size of the data in a cell can be automatically adjusted to fit into a cell.

06:49
Let us learn how to do it.

06:50
Let's type the text “This is for the month of January” in the cell referenced as B14.

07:00
You see that the text doesn't fit into the cell.

07:03
In order to shrink the text so that it fits, click on the cell referenced as B14 first.

07:11
Now, click on the Format option in the menu bar and then click on Cells.

07:18
Alternately, right-click on the cell and click on Format Cells.

07:24
You see that the “Format Cells” dialog-box opens.

07:28
Click on the Alignment tab in the dialog-box.

07:31
At the bottom of the dialog-box, click on the “Shrink to fit cell size” check-box and then click on the OK button.

07:41
You see that the entire text shrinks and adjusts itself by decreasing its font size so that the text fits into the cell referenced as B14.

07:54
Let's undo the changes.

07:57
This brings us to the end of the Spoken Tutorial on LibreOffice Calc.
