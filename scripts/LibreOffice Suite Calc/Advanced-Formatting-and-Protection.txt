Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on Advanced Formatting and Protection in LibreOffice Calc.

00:07
In this tutorial, we will learn how to:
 Password protect a spreadsheet 
 Password protect a single sheet or a tab in a spreadsheet 
 Define Ranges for a database 
 Use the Subtotal option and 
 Validate cells. 


00:25
Here we are using:
 Ubuntu Linux version 10.04 and 
 LibreOffice Suite version 3.3.4. 


00:35
Let’s open “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods”.

00:40
First, let us learn to password protect this file.

00:44
This option ensures that only people who know the password can open this file.

00:51
From the Main menu, click File and Save As.

00:55
The Save dialog-box appears.

00:58
Next, check the 'Save with password' box.

01:03
Then click Save.

01:06
As we are using the Save As option, we can either save it as a different file or replace the same file.

01:15
Here, let us replace the file.

01:18
Click Yes.

01:20
Then enter a password

01:23
and re-enter the password in Confirm box also and click OK.

01:30
Then, close the "Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods".

01:36
Now, let us re-open this file and check what happens.

01:41
The Enter Password dialog-box appears!

01:45
Let us enter a wrong password here.

01:48
Click OK.

01:50
We get an error message which says that the password is incorrect.

01:56
Now, type the correct password.

01:59
The file opens.

02:01
How do we remove the password option? It’s simple too.

02:07
We un-check the Save with password option.

02:10
Again, as we use the Save option, we can either save it as a different file or replace the same file.

02:18
Here, let us replace the file.

02:21
Click Yes.

02:23
Let us close and open this file.

02:27
You do not require a password to open the file.

02:31
Let’s learn how to password protect the individual sheets from this file.

02:37
From the menu bar, click on Tools > Protect Document and Sheet.

02:44
The “Protect Sheet” dialog-box appears.

02:47
To protect the sheet, first un-check the options “Select Locked cells” and “Select Unlocked cells”.

02:56
Now, in the “Password” field, let’s enter “abc”, in the lower case and re-enter the password in the “Confirm” field.

03:07
Click OK.

03:08
Now, let’s try to select and modify data in a cell.

03:15
We are not able to select any cell!

03:18
The sheet cannot be modified!

03:22
But what about the other sheets?

03:24
Let’s click on Sheet2.

03:27
Let’s select a cell and try to edit it.

03:30
Calc allows us to edit the cells in the other sheets.

03:35
Let’s go back to the first sheet.

03:38
Now, let’s un-protect the sheet.

03:41
This is simple.

03:43
From the Menu bar, click on “Tools” > “Protect Document” and “Sheet”.

03:49
A dialog-box that requests for the password, appears.

03:53
Enter “abc” in small case in it and click OK.

03:59
We are able to select the cells again!

04:03
Let’s learn about Ranges.

04:06
 You can define a range of cells in a spreadsheet and use it as a database.

04:12
Each row in this database range corresponds to a database record and

04:17
each cell in a row corresponds to a database field.

04:22
You can sort, group, search and perform calculations on the range as you would in any database.

04:30
Let’s define a database in “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods” and sort the data.

04:38
 First, let’s select the items which we require in the database.

04:43
Let’s select all the data under the heading “SN” to "Account" together. We have already learnt how to select data.

04:53
Now, let’s name our database.

04:56
From the Menu bar, click Data and then click on Define Range.

05:02
In the “Name” field, type “dtbs” which is the short-form of database.

05:08
Click OK.

05:10
Again, from the Menu bar, click Data and Select Range.

05:15
Notice that in the “Select Database Range” dialog-box that appears, the name “dtbs” is listed as a database.

05:24
Click on the OK button.

05:27
Now, let’s sort the data in this database.

05:31
From the Menu bar, click Data and Sort.

05:35
In the Sort dialog-box that appears, click the “Sort by”  field and select “SN”.

05:42
Next, from the right side, select “Descending”.

05:47
Under the first “Then by” field, click on the drop-down and select “Cost”.

05:54
Again, from the right side, select “Descending”.

05:58
In the second “Then by” field, click on the drop-down, select “Spent” and then again select “Descending”.

06:07
Click OK.

06:09
The data is sorted under the heading “SN” and in the descending order!

06:15
 In a similar manner, we can perform other operations in the database too!

06:21
Let’s press the CTRL+Z keys to undo the sort and get the original data.

06:28
Now, let’s learn how to use the “Subtotal” option in Calc.

06:34
The “Subtotal” option, calculates the grand total of data under different headings, using a mathematical function of our choice.

06:43
Let’s find the subtotal of the data under the heading “Cost”.

06:49
First, let’s delete the entry in row number 8.

06:53
select all data under SN to ACCOUNT together.

06:59
Next, from the Menu bar, click Data and Subtotals.

07:04
In the Subtotals dialog-box that appears, from the “Group by” field, let us select “SN”.

07:11
This groups the data by Serial Number.

07:15
Next, in the “Calculate subtotals for” field, click on the “Cost” option.

07:21
This will calculate the total of all the entries under it.

07:26
Under the “Use function” field , let’s choose “Sum” and click OK.

07:33
Notice that the “Grand total” of the entries, under the heading “Costs”, is displayed on the spreadsheet.

07:41
On the left side of the sheet there are 3 new tabs “1”, ”2”and “3”.

07:47
These tabs give 3 different views of the data.

07:52
Let’s click on tab 1.

07:54
Notice that only the grand total of the data under “Costs” is displayed.

08:00
Click on tab “2” .

08:02
The data under “Costs” as well as the grand total is displayed.

08:08
Now, click on tab “3”.

08:11
We get the detailed view of the sheet along with the grand total of the data under “Costs”.

08:18
Let’s close this file.

08:21
A dialog-box with the message Save or Discard changes appears.

08:26
Click Discard.

08:28
Now, let’s re-open the file.

08:31
Now, let’s learn about the “Validity” option in LibreOffice Calc.

08:37
 The “Validity” option validates data in the spreadsheet.

08:41
This is done by specifying the “Validation rules” for the selected cells in the spreadsheet.

08:49
For example- in “Personal-Finance-Tracker.ods”, we can specify the mode of payment for the items bought, using Validation.

08:59
Now, let us delete the heading “Date” and its contents.

09:04
Let us give another heading for “Mode of Payment” as “M-O-P”, next to the heading “Received”.

09:12
Below the heading “M-O-P”, the cells can be used to display the mode of payments for the data entries under the heading “Items”.

09:21
That is, ”Salary”, ”Electricity Bills” and the other components.

09:27
Now, let us click on the empty cell just below the heading ”M-O-P”.

09:33
This will have the mode of payment for the component “Salary”.

09:38
Now, from the Menu bar, click “Data” and “Validity”.

09:43
The Validity dialog-box appears.

09:47
Let’s click the “Criteria” tab.

09:50
From the “Allow” field drop-down, click “List”.

09:55
The “Entries” box pops-up.

09:58
Let’s enter the options which will appear on validating the selected cell.

10:05
Let’s type the first mode of payment as “In Cash” and then press the Enter key from the keyboard.

10:13
Next, let’s type the second mode of payment as “Demand Draft”.

10:19
Click OK.

10:21
The selected cells are validated!

10:25
Now, press the down-arrow that is displayed alongside.

10:30
Can you see the options that we entered as Mode of Payments in the Entries box?

10:36
To validate the cells below, first click on the Format Paintbrush option on the toolbar.

10:43
Then, select the cells below the validated cell by pressing the left mouse button and then dragging along the cells.

10:53
Now, release the mouse button.

10:57
All the selected cells are validated in the same manner.

11:09
Now, click on the cell just below the heading “M-O-P” and then click on the down-arrow.

11:17
Both the options for mode of payment are displayed.

11:21
Let’s select the In Cash option.

11:25
In the same manner, you can select “Cash” or “Demand Draft” in each of the validated cells according to the mode of payment made.

11:36
