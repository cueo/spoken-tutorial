Formatting of borders can be done on a particular cell or a block of cells.

For example, let us format the cells with the headings “Serial Number”, “Item”, “Cost”, “Spent”, ”Received”, ”Date” and ”Account”.

So, let us first click on the cell with the heading Serial Number, denoted by “SN”.

Now, hold down the left mouse button and drag it along the cells containing the headings.

After selecting the entire horizontal row containing the headings, click on the “Borders” icon on the Formatting toolbar.

A drop down box opens up containing several border styles.

Click on one of the styles you want to apply on the borders.

I will click on the last option.

We see that the borders get formatted according to  our selected style.

Let us undo this change.

The selected cells are still highlighted. Right-click on the selection and choose “Format Cells” option.

Now click on the “Borders” tab.

You will see the options for “Line arrangement”, “Line”, “Spacing to contents” and “Shadow style”.

Displayed in each of these are the default settings of Calc.

But one can change any of these to suit our requirement.

Under “User-defined”, you can see a small preview window which displays the selection.

I will choose the third option under “Default” and you can see that it is reflected in the preview window.

I will also change the “Style”, “Width” and “Color”.

Again, notice the change in the preview window.

Spacing to contents has the “Synchronize” option checked.

This means that the same spacing is applied to all the margins.

One can uncheck it and change the margin spacing as per the requirement.

I will change “Top” and “Bottom” margins to 1.4pt.

I will leave you to explore the various Shadow styles, on your own.

Click on OK.

This will apply the chosen style to the selected cells.
