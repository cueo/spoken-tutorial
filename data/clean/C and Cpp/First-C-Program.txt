welcome spoken tutorial first c program tutorial learn write simple c program compile execute also explain common errors solutions record tutorial using ubuntu operating system version 1110 gcc compiler version 461 ubuntu practice tutorial familiar ubuntu operating system editor editors vim gedit use gedit tutorial relevant tutorials please visit website shown httpspokentutorialorg let tell write c program example open terminal window pressing ctrl alt keys simultaneously keyboard lets open text editor prompt type “gedit” space “talk” dot “c” space “” sign use ampersand free prompt please note c files extension “c”dot c press enter text editor opened let us start write program type double slash “” space “my first c program” double slash used comment line comments used understand flow program useful documentation gives us information program double slash called single line comment press enter type hash “include” space opening bracket closing bracket always good practice complete brackets first start writing inside inside bracket type“stdio” “dot” “h” stdioh header file program must contain header file uses standard inputoutput functions press enter type “int” space “main” opening bracket closing bracket main special function denotes execution program begins line opening bracket closing bracket called parenthesis parenthesis followed main tell user main function int main function takes arguments returns value type integer learn data types another tutorial let us switch slides know main function let us go next slide every program one main function one main function otherwise compiler cannot locate beginning program empty pair parentheses indicates main arguments concept arguments discussed detail upcoming tutorials let us come back program press enter type opening curly bracket “{” opening curly bracket marks beginning function main type closing curly bracket “}” closing curly bracket indicates end function main inside bracket press enter twice move cursor one line indentation makes code easier read also helps locate errors faster let us give three space type “printf” opening bracket closing bracket “” printf standard c function print output terminal inside brackets within double quotes anything within double quotes printf statement printed terminal type“talk teacher backslash n” backslash n “\n” signifies newline result execution printf function cursor moves new line every c statement must end semicolon “” hence type end line semicolon acts statement terminator press enter give three space type “return” space “0” semicolon statement returns integer zero integer returned function function type int return statement marks end executable statements learn returned values another tutorial click onsave button save file good habit save files frequently protect sudden power failures also useful case applications crash let us compile program come back terminal type “gcc” space “talkc” space hyphen “o” space “myoutput” gcc compiler talkc filename myoutput says executable go file myoutput press enter see program compiled typing ls space hypen lrt see myoutput last file created execute program type dot slash“myoutput” press enter output displayed “talk teacher” said return last statement executed thus return statement nothing executed let us try come back program return statement let us include one printf statement give space type printf opening bracket closing bracket inside bracket within double quotes type welcome backslash n end type semicolon click save let us compile execute come back terminal recall previously entered commands using arrowkey see second statement welcome executed come back program let us write welcome statement return statement click save let us compile execute see second printf statement welcome also executed let us see common errors come across come back program suppose miss dot “stdioh” click save let us compile execute see fatal error line no2 talkc file compiler cannot find header file name “stdioh” hence giving error file directory compilation terminated let us fix error come back program reinsert dot “” click save let us compile execute yes working show another common error let us switch back program suppose miss semicolon end line click save let us compile execute see error line no6 talkc file expected semicolon printf come back program said semicolon acts statement terminator search end line5 beginning line6 line 6 last place put semicolon recall compiler also gives error message line 6 let us try happens put semicolon click save let us compile execute yes working come back program let us type semicolon end line conventional practice type semicolon end line click save let us compile execute yes working let us go back slides assignment write program print welcome world c see happens “\n” included printf statement brings us end tutorial watch video available link shown summarises spoken tutorial project good bandwidth download watch spoken
