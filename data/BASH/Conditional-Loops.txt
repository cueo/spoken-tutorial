 Dear friends, welcome to the spoken tutorial on loops in BASH.

 00:07
  In this tutorial, we will learn:

 00:09
 * for loop

 00:11
 * while loop with a few examples.

 00:15
 To record this tutorial, I am using:

 00:18
 * Ubuntu Linux 12.04 Operating System 

 00:22
 * GNU BASH version 4.1.10

 00:26
 Please note, GNU bash version 4 or above is recommended to practice this tutorial.

 00:34
   Let us start with an introduction to  loops.

 00:37
 Loops are used to execute a group of statements repeatedly.

 00:43
  Let us see the syntax.

 00:45
 for expression 1, 2, 3

 00:49
 statement 1, 2, 3

 00:51
 and this is the end of for loop.

 00:55
  An alternate syntax of for loop is:

 00:58
 for variable in sequence/range

 01:03
 statement 1, 2, 3

 01:06
 and end of for loop.

 01:09
 Let us see an example of for loop using the first syntax.

 01:14
 In this program, we will calculate the sum of first n numbers.

 01:20
  Note that our filename is for.sh.

 01:25
  This is our shebang line.

 01:28
   The variable number will store the value given by user.

  01:34
 The value is an integer here.

  01:37
 Now, we initialize the variable sum as zero.

  01:42
  This is where we begin the for loop.

 01:45
 First, we initialize 'i' to 1.

 01:48
 Then we check whether 'i' is less than or equal to number.

 01:54
  Now here, we calculate the sum as sum plus i

  02:00
 and then we print it.

 02:03
   After this, we increment the value of 'i' by 1.

 02:08
  And then we check the condition till this condition is False.

  02:14
  On exiting the for loop, this message is printed.

  02:19
  Let us execute the program and observe what happens.

 02:24
  On the terminal, type - chmod +x for.sh

 02:31
 Then type: ./for.sh

  02:36
  I will enter 5 as the input number.

  02:40
 The sum that is calculated for each value of 'i' is displayed.

  02:46
 After that, the last line of the output is displayed:

  02:50
 "Sum of first n numbers is 15".

  02:54
 Now, let us see the flow of the program.

  02:57
 Let me resize the windows.

  03:00
   First, we have value of 'i' as 1.

  03:04
  Then we check whether 1 is less than or equal to  5.

  03:10
 Since the condition is True, we calculate the sum as 0 + 1.

  03:16
 Now we have the sum as 1.

  03:20
 Then we print sum  i.e 1.

  03:24
  Next, 'i' is incremented by 1 and the new value of 'i' is 2.

  03:31
 Then we check whether  2  is less than or equal to  5.

  03:36
 The condition is True and now sum will be  1 + 2  i.e  3.

 03:44
    'i' is then incremented by 1 and then the new value of 'i' is 3.

 03:51
 And we get sum as  6.

 03:55
  The script will continue to add the next value of 'i' to the previous value in  sum.

 04:02
 This will continue till i<=5 is False.

 04:09
  On exiting the for loop, the final message is printed.

 04:14
  Let us see another example of for loopusing the second syntax.

 04:20
 I have written the code in this file and named it as for-loop.sh.

 04:27
 This simple program will list the files in a directory.

 04:32
 This is the shebang line.

 04:35
  Then we have for loop.

 04:37
  'ls'  command lists the directory content.

 04:41
 -1 (hyphen one) lists one file per line.

 04:46
 This will list all the files present in your home directory.

  04:51
 This is the end of for loop.

 04:53
  Let us execute the script on the terminal by typing -

 04:58
 chmod +x for-loop.sh

 05:04
 Type: ./for-loop.sh

 05:09
  This will display all the files present in the Home directory.

 05:14
   Now we will learn about  while loop.

 05:18
 Let us understand the syntax first.

 05:21
 while condition
statement 1, 2, 3
end of while loop.

 05:27
 This means that the while loop will execute as long as the condition is True.

05:34
Let us see an example of while loop.

  05:37
 Here, I have named it as while.sh.

  05:42
 In this program, we will calculate the sum of even numbers within a given range.

05:49
 Let us go through the code.

05:52
 Here, we accept a number from the user and store it in variable number.

05:59
   Next, we declare variables 'i' and sum and initialize them to  0 (zero).

06:06
Now, this is the while condition.

 06:08
 Here, we check whether 'i' is less than or equal to value of number given by the user.

 06:17
  Then we calculate the sum by adding value of 'i' to value of sum.

  06:24
  Next, we increment the value of 'i' with 2.

  06:28
 This will ensure that we only add the even numbers.

  06:33
 And the while loop is repeated till the value of 'i' exceeds the value of number.

  06:40
  When we exit the while loop, we print the sum of all the even numbers within the given range.

  06:47
 Let us execute the program.

 06:50
  Type on the terminal:

 06:52
 chmod +x while.sh

 06:56
 ./while.sh

  07:00
  I will give 15 as my input.

  07:04
  The last line of the output is:

  07:06
 "Sum of even numbers within the given range is 56".

 07:11
  Let me resize the window and explain the output.

 07:14
  First we check whether 'i' which is 0, is less than or equal to the number which is 15.

  07:24
  The condition is True. Hence sum will be '0+0' i.e 0.

  07:31
 Now 'i' will be incremented by 2 and the new value of 'i' is  2.

  07:37
   Then we check if 2 is less than or equal to 15.

  07:43
   The condition again is True; so we add 0+2.

  07:49
 Now sum  has the value 2.

  07:52
  Again the value of 'i' will be incremented by 2.

  07:56
 So, now value of 'i' will be 2+2 i.e 4.

  08:03
  And the next value of  sum  will be 4+2 i.e 6.

  08:09
   In the same way, the script will continue to add 2 to the previous value of 'i', till it exceeds 15.

  08:18
 And we get the total value in sum as  56.

 08:24
 This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

 08:27
 Let us summarize.

 08:28
 In this tutorial, we learned two different syntax of for loop  and we also learned about the while loop.
