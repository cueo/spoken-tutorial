 Dear friends, welcome to the spoken tutorial on Basics of functions in Bash.

  00.08
 In this tutorial, we will learn:

  00.11
* Importance of Functions

  00.13
* To declare a function

  00.15
* To call a function

  00.17
* Work flow of a function

  00.19
 with the help of an example.

  00.22
 To follow this tutorial, you should have knowledge of Shell Scripting in BASH.

  00.28
If not, for relevant tutorials, please visit our website which is as shown. http://www.spoken-tutorial.org

 00.34
 For this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu Linux 12.04 Operating System.

  00.40
Till now we were using GNU BASH version 4.1.10

  00.46
From now onwards, we will use GNU BASH version 4.2

  00.52
Please note, GNU Bash version 4 or above is recommended for practice.

 00.58
 Let us see what is a function and its usage.

  01.03
 A function is a collection of commands or an algorithm.

  01.08
 It is intended to do a specific task.

  01.12
 It is used to break-up a complex program into separate tasks.

  01.18
 This improves overall script readability and ease of use.

 01.24
 There are two syntaxes for function declaration.

 01.28
 First syntax is-

  01.29
function space function_name

 01.32
within curly brackets,

  01.34
the commands to be executed.

  01.37
 The second syntax is-

  01.39
function_name open and close round brackets

  01.42
within curly brackets,

  01.44
the commands to be executed.

  01.47
 Function call-

  01.48
Function can be called anywhere within the program.

  01.53
Type the function name at the location where you want to call it.

  01.58
The syntax is the function_name itself.

 02.02
 Let us understand this with the help of a simple example.

 02.07
 I have already typed the code in a file function.sh.

 02.12
 This is the shebang line.

 02.14
 Function is declared by the keyword function followed by function name.

  02.21
Here, the function name is machine.

 02.26
 The contents within curly brackets is called function definition.

  02.32
I have displayed various machine details like-

  02.36
uname hyphen a gives machine information.

  02.41
w hyphen h gives users logged onto system.

  02.46
uptime gives the time since machine was on.

  02.51
free gives memory status.

  02.54
df hyphen h gives filesystem status.

 02.57
 The main program starts here.

03.01
We display the message  “Beginning of main program” .

 03.06
 Here, machine is a function call. 

 03.09
 Then we display the message “End of main program”.

 03.13
 Let us understand the workflow.

  03.16
# When the bash interpreter visits the function definition, it simply scans the function.

  03.23
# The function is called only when its name appears within the script.

  03.28
# When the interpreter reads the function name, it executes the function definition.

  03.36
 The interpreter treats function name as a command.

  03.41
Please remember that we have to define the function before calling it.

 03.47
 Now go to the terminal. To make this code file executable,

  03.52
type: chmod space plus x space function dot sh

  03.59
Press Enter.

 04.01
  Type: dot slash function dot sh

  04.05
Press Enter.

 04.07
 The output that is the machine details of my system are seen on the terminal.

  04.14
Please Note: The output will vary from system to system.

  04.19
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

  04.22
Come back to our slides.

 04.24
 Let us summarize.

  04.25
In this tutorial, we learned:

  04.28
* Importance of functions

  04.30
* Function declaration

  04.32
* Function call

  04.33
* Work flow of function

  04.35
 with an example.

 04.37
 As an assignment-

  04.38
write a program with two functions.

  04.42
# The first function should display the disk-space usage in human readable form (Hint: df hyphen h).

  04.51
# The second function should display filesystem usage in human readable form (Hint: du hyphen h).
