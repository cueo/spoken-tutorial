Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on 2 Dimensional Arrays in C and C++.

 00:08
In this tutorial, we will learn-

 00:10
what is a 2 Dimensional array.

 00:13
We will do this through an example.

 00:16
To record this tutorial, I am using

 00:18
 Ubuntu Operating System version 11.10,

 00:22
gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu.

 00:29
 Let us start with the introduction to 2 dimensional Array.

 00:33
2D arrays are stored in a row column matrix.

00:38
 The left index indicates the row.

00:41
The right index indicates the column.

00:44
Starting index of a matrix or array in C and C++ is always 0.

00:52
Here, we see a 2 Dimensional array in a row column matrix.

 00:58
Starting index is 0.

01:01
Now, let us see how to declare 2 dimensional array.

 01:04
The Syntax for this is:

 01:07
data-type ,array name, row and column.

01:13
example, here we have declared a 2 dimensional array num with 2 rows and 3 columns.

 01:21
Now let us see an example.

 01:23
I have already typed the program, let me open it.

01:28
Note that our file name is 2d hyphen array dot c.

01:33
In this program, we will calculate the sum of the elements of the 2 dimensional array.

01:41
Let me explain the code now.

01:44
This is our header file.

01:46
This is our main() function.

01:49
Here we have declared variables i and j.

 01:53
Then we have declared num1 with 3 rows and 4 columns.

 01:58
And num2, again with 3 rows and 4 columns.

 02:03
num1 and num2 are 2 dimensional arrays.

 02:07
Here, we take elements of the matrix num1 as input from the user.

02:13
The elements are stored row-wise.

02:16
We have considered i for rows and j for columns.

02:22
This for loop will check the condition that i runs from 0 to 2.

 02:28
This for loop will check the condition that j runs from 0 to 3.

 02:33
 Similarly, here we take elements of the matrix num2 as input from the user.

 02:40
 Here we display the matrix num1.

 02:43
  Here percent 3d is used to align the matrix on the terminal.

 02:49
 Now, here we display the matrix num2.

02:52
Then we add the num1 matrix and the num2 matrix and display the result.

 02:59
 This is our return statement.

 03:01
Now, click on Save.

 03:05
 Let us execute the program.

 03:07
Please open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

 03:15
 To compile, type gcc space 2d hyphen array dot c space hyphen o space arr and press Enter.

 03:28
To execute, type dot slash arr (./arr), now press Enter .

 03:34
Here we see Enter the elements of 3 into 4 array num1.

 03:39
 I will enter the values now.

 03:52
 Now we can see Enter the elements of 3 into 4 array num2.

 03:57
I will enter the values.

 04:10
 The output is displayed.

 04:13
Here we can see the num1 matrix.

 04:16
Here we can see the num2 matrix.

 04:20
And this is the sum of num1 and num2.

 04:24
Now we will see how to execute the same program in C++.

 04:29
I have already made the program. I will open it and explain.

 04:34
This is the program for 2 Dimensional arrays in C++.

 04:38
 Note that our file name is 2d hyphen array dot cpp.

 04:43
The extension is dot cpp (.cpp).

 04:47
Let me explain the code now.

 04:50
This is our header file as iostream.

 04:53
This is our using statement.

 04:56
This is our main() function.

 04:58
Here we have cout function as we use cout to print the output in C++.

 05:06
Then we have cin function. We use cin to read  a line in C++.

 05:13
Here, we use  / t  bit mean horizontal tab that is equivalent to 4 spaces.

 05:21
Rest of the code is similar to our C code.

 05:25
Now click on Save.

 05:27
Let us execute.

 05:28
Come back to a terminal.

 05:31
Let me clear the prompt.

 05:33
To compile, type g++ space 2d hyphen array dot cpp  hyphen o space arr1 and press  Enter.

 05:47
To execute, type dot slash arr1, now press Enter.

 05:52
Here we see Enter the elements of 3 into 4 array num1.

 05:57
I will enter the values.

 06:07
Now, we see Enter the elements of 3 into 4 array num2.

 06:13
I will give the values as:

 06:24
The output is displayed.

 06:26
We can see the num1 matrix, the num2 matrix.

 06:31
And this is the sum of num1 and num2.

 06:36
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

 06:39
Come back to our slide. Let us Summarize.

 06:43
In this tutorial we learnt:

 06:45
 *To add elements in a 2D array.

 06:48
 *To print 2D array.

 06:50
 *And to calculate the sum of 2Dimensional array.

 06:54
As an assignment:

 06:55
Write the  program that takes two 2Dimensional arrays as input from the user.

 07:01
Subtract them and find the result.
