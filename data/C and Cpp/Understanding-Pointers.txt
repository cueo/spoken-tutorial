Welcome to the spoken tutorial on Pointers in C and C++ .

 00:06
In this tutorial we will learn:

 00:08
* Pointers

 00:10
* To create Pointers

 00:12
* And operations on Pointers.

 00:14
 We will do this with the help of an example.

 00:18
To record this tutorial, I am using Ubuntu operating system version 11.10,

 00:25
 gcc and g++ compiler version 4.6.1 on Ubuntu.

 00:31
Let us start with an introduction to pointers.

00:34
Pointers point to the locations in memory.

00.38
Pointers store the memory address.

 00:41
It also gives value stored at that address.

 00:45
Now, let us see an example on pointers.

 00:48
Note that our file name is pointers_demo.c.

 00:54
Let us go through the code now.

 00:56
This is our header file as stdio.h.

 01:00
This is our main() function.

 01:03
Here we have long integer num, assigned value 10.

 01:09
Then we have declared a pointer ptr.

 01:12
Asterisk sign is used to declare a pointer.

 01:16
This pointer can point to type long  int. 

 01:20
In the 'printf' statement, ampersand is used for retrieving memory address of the variable.

01:28
So, ampersand num (&num) will give the memory address of num.

 01:33
This statement will print the address of the variable num.

 01:37
Over here, ptr stores the address of num.

 01:41
This statement will print the address of ptr.

 01:45
sizeof() function will give the size of ptr.

01:49
This is will give the value of ptr.

01:51
That is the memory address of num.

01:54
And here asterisk ptr will give the value at the address.

01:59
So, using asterisk will not give the memory address.

02:03
Instead it will give the value.

02:06
%ld is a format specifier for the long int.

02:10
Now, let us execute the program.

02:13
Open the terminal window by pressing Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

02:21
To compile, type gcc space  pointers underscore demo dot c space hyphen o space point

02:32
Press Enter.

02:34
Type dot slash point. Press Enter.

02:39
The output is displayed.

 02:42
We see that the num address and ptr value is same

 02:48
 where as memory address of num and ptr are different.

 02:53
Then the size of pointer is 8 bytes.

 02:57
 Also the value pointed by ptr is 10 which was assigned to num.

 03:03
 Now let us see the same program in  C++.

 03:07
 Note that our file name is pointer underscore demo.cpp.

 03:13
 Here we have a few changes like the header file as iostream.

 03:19
Then we are using the std namespace.

 03:23
And here we have the cout function in place of printf() function.

 03:28
Rest all the things are similar.

 03:30
Let us execute the program. Come back to our terminal.

 03:34
To compile, type g++ space pointers_demo.cpp space hyphen o space point1, press Enter.

 03:50
Type dot slash point1, press Enter.

 03:55
 We can see that the output is similar to our C program.

 04:00
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

 04:03
 Come back to our slide.

 04:05
Let us summarize.

 04:06
In this tutorial, we learnt:

 04:08
About the pointer.

 04:10
To create a pointer.

 04:12
And operation on pointer.

 04:14
As an assignment, write a C and C++ program

 04:18
to declare a variable and pointer.

 04:21
 Store the address of variable in the pointer.

 04:24
And print the value of the pointer.
