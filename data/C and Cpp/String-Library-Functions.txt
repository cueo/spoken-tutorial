Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on String Library Functions in C.

 00:07
In this tutorial we will learn

 00:09
String Library Functions.

 00:11
We will do this with the help of some examples.

 00:15
To record this tutorial, I am using

 00:18
 Ubuntu Operating System version 11.10,

 00:22
gcc Compiler Version 4.6.1.

 00:27
Let us start with an introduction to string library functions.

 00:31
These are the group of functions implementing operations on strings.

00:36
Various operations such as copying, concatenation, searching etc are supported.

00:44
Let us see some of the string library functions.

00:48
Here we have the strncpy function.

00:52
The syntax for this is strncpy(char str1, char str2, and int n ); 

01:02
It copies first n characters of string str2  into string str1.

 01:09
example, char strncpy( char hello, char world, 2);

 01:16
The output will be Wollo .

01:21
Here we have Wo from the string 2 and rest of the characters from string 1.

 01:29
Now we will see strncmp function, the syntax for this is strncmp(char str1, char str2, and int n); 

 01:42
It will compare first n characters of string 2 with string 1.

 01:48
example int strncmp(char ice, char icecream, and  2);

01:55
The output will be 0.

 01:58
Now we will see how to use the string library functions.

 02:02
I am going to show you some of the commonly used string functions.

02:07
I have already typed the program on the editor,

02:10
 I will open it.

02:12
Here, we have the string length function.

02:15
Note that our file name is strlen.c. 

02:20
In this, we will find the length of the string.

02:23
These are the header files as stdio.h and string.h. 

02:29
This is our main() function.

 02:31
Here we have a character variable  'arr'. 

 02:35
It stores a value  'Ashwini' .

 02:38
Then we have an integer variable len1 .

 02:42
Here we will find the length of the string using strlen function.

 02:48
The result will be stored in 'len1'.

 02:52
Then we print the string and the length of the string.

02:56
And this is our return statement.

02:59
Now let us execute the program.

03:01
Open the terminal window by pressing

 03:04
Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

 03:09
 To compile, type:  "gcc"  space  "strlen.c"  space  “-o” space “str1”.  Press Enter.

 03:19
Type (dot slash) ./str1. Press Enter.

 03:24
The output is displayed as

 03:26
string = Ashwini, Length = 7 

03:30
You can count here. 1,2,3,4,5,6, and 7.

 03:37
 Let us see another string function.

 03:40
Here we have the string copy function.

 03:43
Note that our file name is strcpy.c .

 03:48
In this, we will copy the source string into the target string.

 03:53
Here we have 'Ice' in the source string, it will be copied to the target string.

 03:59
This is our strcpy function

 04:02
Here we will print the source string and the target string.

 04:07
Let us execute and see.

 04:09
Come back to our terminal.

 04:11
 To compile, type gcc space strcpy.c space hyphen  o space str2. Press  Enter

 04:20
Type (dot slash)./str2 . Press Enter .

 04:24
The output is displayed as:

 04:26
source string = Ice 

 04:29
target string = Ice 

 04:32
 Now let us see another string function.

 04:34
Now we will see the string compare function.

 04:37
Note that our file name is strcmp.c.

 04:42
In this, we will compare two strings.

 04:46
Here we have character variables as str1 and str2 .

 04:52
str1 stores the value as  'Ice' and str2 stores the value as  'Cream'.

 04:58
Here we have integer variables as i and j.

 05:03
In this we will compare the string using the strcmp function.

 05:08
Here we compare str1 i.e 'Ice' with 'Hello'.

 05:14
The result is stored in i.

 05:16
In this we will compare string2 i.e 'Cream' with 'Cream'

 05:23
The result is stored in j.

 05:25
Then we print both the results.

 05:28
And this is our return statement.

 05:31
Let us execute the program.

 05:33
Come back to our terminal.

 05:35
To compile type gcc space strcmp.c space hyphen o space str3

 05:46
Press Enter.

 05:47
Type (dot slash) ./str3 

 05:50
The output is displayed as 1, 0.

 05:54
Come back to our program.

 05:56
Here we get 1 and here we get as 0.

 06:01
Let us come back to our slides.

 06:04
Let us summarize.

 06:06
In this tutorial we learned,

 06:07
String library functions-

 06:09
* strlen()

 06:11
* strcpy()

 06:13
* strcmp()

 06:14
* strncpy()

 06:16
*and strncmp().

 06:19
As an assignemnt,

 06:21
write a C Program to concatenate String 'best' and String 'bus'.

 06:25
Hint: strcat(char str1, char str2);

 06:32
Also explore the other functions in string library.
