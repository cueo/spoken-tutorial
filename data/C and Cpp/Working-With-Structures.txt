Welcome to the spoken-tutorial on Structures in C and C++.

 00:06
In this tutorial we will learn,

 00:08
* What is a Structure. 

 00:10
* Declaration of a structure.

 00:13
We will do this through an example.

 00:15
 To record this tutorial, I am using

 00:18
Ubuntu Operating System  version 11.10,

 00:22
 gcc and g++ Compiler version 4.6.1.

 00:28
Let us start with an introduction to Structure .

00:31
When one or more variables are grouped under one name, it is known as structure.

00:37
Structure is used to group different data into one object.

00:42
It is called as compound data-type.

 00:45
It is used to group related information together.

 00:49
  Now we will see the syntax to declare a structure.

 00:52
Here, the keyword struct tells the compiler that a structure is declared.

 00:59
strcut_name is the name of the structure.

 01:02
eg. struct employee; 

 01:04
You can give any name.

 01:07
Now we will see how to declare a structure variable.

01:10
The syntax for this is:

 01:13
struct struct_name and  struct_var; 

 01:17
struct_var is the variable of type struc_name.

 01:21
example, struct employee addr; 

 01:26
addr is the variable of type employee. 

01:30
Let us move on to our example.

01:33
I have already typed the program on the editor. So, let me open it.

01:37
Note that our file name is structure.c.

01:41
In this program we will calculate the total marks of three subjects using structure.

01:48
Let me explain the code now.

01:51
This is our header file.

 01:53
Here we have declared a structure as student.

 01:57
 Then we have declared three integer variables as English, maths and science. 

 02:03
Variables defined under the structure are called as members of the structure.

02:09
This is our main() function.

 02:11
 Here we have declared an integer variable 'total'.

 02:16
 Now we have declared a structure variable stud, stud is the variable of type student, it is used to access and modify the structure members.

 02:28
 Here we have modified the members

 02:31
by assigning them values as 75, 70 and 65.

 02:37
Here we calculate the total of three subjects.

 02:41
Then we print the result.

 02:44
This is our return statement.

 02:46
Now click on Save .

 02:48
Let us execute the program.

 02:50
Please open the terminal window by pressing

 02:54
 Ctrl, Alt and T keys simultaneously on your keyboard.

 02:59
 To compile, type gcc space structure.c space hyphen o space struct and press Enter.

 03:12
To execute, type (dot slash)./struct. Press Enter.

 03:17
The output is displayed as:

 03:20
Total is 210

 03:22
Now we will execute the same program in C++ .

 03:26
Come back to our program.

 03:28
I will edit the same code.

 03:30
First press Shift, Ctrl and  S keys simultaneously on the keyboard.

 03:37
Now save the file with an extension .cpp 

 03:41
 and click on save.

 03:43
 Let's change the header file as iostream.

 03:47
Now include the using statement

 03:53
and click on save.

 03:56
Structure declaration in C++ is same as in C.

 04:01
So, no need to change anything here.

 04:05
At the end we will replace the printf statement with the cout  statement.

 04:12
Delete the format specifier and (backslash n) \n.

 04:15
Now delete the comma.

 04:17
Type two opening angle brackets.

 04:20
Here, delete the closing bracket

 04:22
and type two opening angle brackets.

 04:25
And within the double quotes, type \n (backslash n).

 04:29
Now click on Save.

 04:31
Let us execute the program.

 04:33
Come back to our terminal.

 04:35
To compile, type g++ space structure.cpp space hyphen o space struct1 .

 04:46
 Here we have struct1 because we don't want to overwrite the output parameters struct for the file structure.c .

 04:55
Now press Enter.

 04:57
To execute, type (dot slash) ./struct1. Press Enter.

 05:03
The output is displayed as:

 05:05
Total is 210

 05:08
You can see that the output is same as our C code.

 05:12
Now let us go back to our slides.

 05:14
We will summarize now. In this tutorial we learned,

 05:18
* Structure

 05:19
* Syntax of a structure

 05:20
eg. struct struct_name; 

 05:23
* To access members of a structure.

 05:25
Eg: stud.maths = 75;

 05:30
* And to add the structure variables.

 05:33
Eg: total = stud.eng + stud.maths + stud.science;

 05:40
As an assignment,

 05:41
write a program to display  records of an employee.

 05:44
Like name, address, designation, and salary.
